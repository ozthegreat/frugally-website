# Standalone Setup

A **Standalone Connection** links frugally.app to a single AWS account. No Organisation or wizard required — you create one IAM role in AWS and fill in one form in frugally.app.

[Open the Add Connection form →](https://dashboard.frugally.app/connections/create)

---

## When to use standalone

- You have a **single AWS account** (not part of an AWS Organisation)
- You want to connect **one specific account** without onboarding your entire organisation
- You are **evaluating frugally.app** and want the simplest setup path

If you have multiple accounts under an AWS Organisation, consider the [Organisation setup](./organisation-setup.md) instead — it automates discovery and policy generation.

---

## Prerequisites

- A frugally.app account — [sign in](https://dashboard.frugally.app)
- Your 12-digit AWS account ID
- IAM permissions to create roles and policies in that account

---

## Step 1 — Create the IAM policy in AWS

Sign in to the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies) for the account you want to connect.

Create a new IAM policy with the permissions frugally.app needs. The connection form in the dashboard shows the exact policy based on the services and features you select. A minimal example for EC2-only scheduling:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "FrugallyResourceDiscovery",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "tag:GetResources",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
        "ec2:DescribeTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FrugallyEC2Actions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For the full policy covering all supported services (EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS, NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoint) and optional features (Cost Explorer, CloudTrail, CUR), see the [IAM policy reference](./iam-policies.md).

:::tip
The dashboard connection form generates the exact policy you need based on your selections. Use that instead of copying the minimal example above.

## Step 2 — Create the IAM role in AWS

1. In the [IAM Roles console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles), click **Create role**.
2. Select **Another AWS account** as the trusted entity type.
3. Enter the frugally.app account ID: `829513654501`.
4. Check **Require external ID** and paste the External ID shown in the frugally.app connection form.
5. Click **Next** and attach the policy you created in Step 1.
6. Name the role (default: `FrugallyAccessRole`). The name must match what you enter in the frugally.app form.
7. Click **Create role**.

:::note What is the External ID?
The External ID is a unique token (ULID) auto-generated by frugally.app. It is included in the IAM trust policy to prevent [confused-deputy attacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html). Only frugally.app knows this value, so only frugally.app can assume the role.
:::

The trust policy attached to the role will look like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::829513654501:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Fill in the connection form

Back in frugally.app, fill in the connection form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Connection Name** | A friendly label (e.g. `Production`, `Dev Account`, `Staging US-East`). |
| **AWS Account ID** | Your 12-digit AWS account ID. |
| **Role Name** | The IAM role name you created in Step 2. Default: `FrugallyAccessRole`. |
| **External ID** | Auto-generated. Must match the External ID in your IAM trust policy. |
| **Environment** | **Production** or **Non-Production**. Used for access control via [Scopes](../scopes.md). |
| **Tier** | *(Non-production only)* Optional sub-label: **Dev**, **Staging**, **Test**, or **Sandbox**. |

### Optional features

Toggle any features you want to enable for this Connection:

| Feature | What it adds |
|---------|-------------|
| **CloudTrail** | Read access to CloudTrail audit logs. |
| **Cost Explorer** | Read access to AWS Cost Explorer spend data. AWS charges $0.01 per API call — frugally.app enforces daily and monthly caps. |
| **CUR** | Read access to Cost and Usage Reports stored in S3. |

Each feature requires additional IAM permissions on the role. See [Features](./features.md) for details and [IAM policy reference](./iam-policies.md) for the exact permissions.

---

## Step 4 — Verify

Click **Save**. frugally.app immediately verifies the Connection by assuming the IAM role and testing each enabled feature.

| Result | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Connected** | Everything works. |
| **Degraded** | Role assumption works, but one or more features failed detection. |
| **Missing Permissions** | Role assumption failed. Check the role name, External ID, and trust policy. |

If verification fails, see the [account health troubleshooting guide](./account-health.md).

## After setup

Once your Standalone Connection is verified:

1. **Create Targets** — Group resources by service, region, and tags. See [Creating Targets](../getting-started/creating-targets.md).
2. **Run an Execution** — Test with a manual action. See [Running an Execution](../getting-started/running-an-execution.md).
3. **Create a Schedule** — Automate recurring start/stop actions. See [Creating a Schedule](../getting-started/creating-a-schedule.md).

---

## Converting to an Organisation later

If you later set up an AWS Organisation and want to bring standalone Connections under it, you can run the [Organisation Setup Wizard](./organisation-setup.md). Existing standalone Connections are not automatically migrated — you would create new member Connections through the wizard and then remove the standalone ones.
