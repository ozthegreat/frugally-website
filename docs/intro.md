# Welcome to frugally.app

frugally.app is a shift-left FinOps platform that helps teams **automate** cloud cost savings, gain **intelligence** into AWS spending, and **govern** infrastructure changes — all from a single dashboard with Slack and GitHub built in.

## What you can do with frugally.app

| Pillar | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Automate** | Define Targets (groups of AWS resources), attach Schedules, and let frugally.app stop, start, and scale resources automatically. |
| **Intelligence** | Explore AWS costs, track Reserved Instance and Savings Plan utilisation, and detect spending anomalies. |
| **Guard** | Create projects for infrastructure changes with approval workflows, set budgets, attribute costs to teams, and run compliance scans. |
