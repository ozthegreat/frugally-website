# Intro

Let's discover **frugally.app**.

If you're new here, start with the [Getting Started](./getting-started/start-here.md) guide. It walks you through connecting your AWS accounts, creating Targets from your resources, configuring Slack notifications, and running your first execution.

For a deep dive on connecting AWS accounts, see the [Connections](./category/connections) section — it covers Organisation setup, Standalone setup, features (CloudTrail, Cost Explorer, CUR), account health, and the full IAM policy reference.

Once you're set up, explore the [Advanced guide](./category/advanced) for topics like IAM policy restrictions and tag filtering.

Enterprise customers can configure [Single Sign-On & Provisioning](./category/single-sign-on--provisioning) to manage authentication and user lifecycle through their identity provider.

Everything to do with [billing and invoicing](./category/billing) can be found there.

For everything else, check out our [FAQs](./category/faqs).

And don't forget, you can always [contact us](mailto:support@frugally.app) if you can't find what you're after.
