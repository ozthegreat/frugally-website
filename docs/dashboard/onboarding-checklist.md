# Onboarding Checklist

The onboarding checklist is a Dashboard widget that guides new teams through initial setup. It tracks your progress across the key steps needed to start saving with frugally.app.

## Checklist items

Each item is automatically marked as complete when you finish the corresponding action. No manual ticking required.

| Step | Completion trigger | Link |
|------|--------------------|------|
| **Connect an AWS account** | At least one Connection is in a healthy state | [Connecting Your AWS Accounts](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts) |
| **Create a Target** | At least one Target exists with matched resources | [Creating Targets](/docs/getting-started/creating-targets) |
| **Run an Execution** | At least one Execution has completed (manual or scheduled) | [Running an Execution](/docs/getting-started/running-an-execution) |
| **Create a Schedule** | At least one active Schedule exists | [Creating a Schedule](/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule) |
| **Connect Slack** | Slack workspace is connected and a default channel is set | [Connecting Slack](/docs/getting-started/connecting-slack) |

## Dismissing the checklist

Once all steps are complete, the checklist auto-collapses. You can also dismiss it early by clicking the **Dismiss** button in the widget header — useful for experienced teams who have already completed setup before the checklist was introduced.

:::tip
Dismissing the checklist is a per-user action. Other team members will still see their own checklist until they complete or dismiss it.

## Resetting the checklist

If you need to revisit the checklist after dismissing it, navigate to **Settings** > **Dashboard** and toggle **Show onboarding checklist** back on.
