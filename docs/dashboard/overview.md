# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is your team's home screen in frugally.app. It provides a real-time summary of your cloud cost savings, active schedules, recent executions, and onboarding progress — all in one place.

[Open the Dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app)

## What you will see

The Dashboard is divided into several widgets, each designed to surface the most important information at a glance.

| Widget | What it shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Savings summary** | Total savings to date, broken down by period (today, this week, this month). |
| **Active schedules** | Number of active Schedules and their next run times. |
| **Recent executions** | The latest Executions with status indicators (succeeded, failed, in progress). |
| **Team activity** | A feed of recent actions taken by team members. |
| **Onboarding checklist** | A progress tracker for new teams to complete initial setup. |
| **Projected vs actual savings** | A chart comparing what your Schedules are expected to save against actual results. |
