# 02 - Adding an Account

The first step is tell frugally.app about your AWS Accounts you'd like it to have access to. 

You can open the **Accounts Screen** by either:

a. From within your Slack app, navigate to the Frugally app home screen. This is usually at the bottom of your conversations list in the side bar. Just click the "Frugally" app.

b.

This is a list of all your AWS Accounts that frugally.app knows about. Frugally.app can only manage Resources in AWS Accounts it's aware of so make sure you've added all your AWS Accounts.

When you're ready to add a new AWS Account, click the "Add account" button in the top right corner.
