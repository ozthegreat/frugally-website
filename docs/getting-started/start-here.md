# 01 - Start Here

This short getting started section will guide you through getting setup with frugally.app, running your first execution and setting up a schedule to do it automatically.

Once you've worked through the getting started guide and have frugally.app setup and working you might wish to look through the [Advanced Section](/docs/category/advanced) of the documentation for more information on things like security as well as the [Billing](/docs/category/billing) section to understand how invoices are raised in more detail. After that [FAQs](/docs/category/faqs) can be found here.

Ok, let's get going. Start by [Adding an Account](adding-an-account.md).
