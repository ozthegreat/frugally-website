# Billing Overview

frugally.app uses a credit-based billing model. Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation, and different actions consume credits based on the AWS service and resource count involved.

[Manage Billing](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/billing)

## How billing works

1. **Choose a plan** — Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation and feature access
2. **Credits are consumed** — Actions like Executions, Scans, and API calls consume credits
3. **Monitor usage** — Track your credit balance and usage from the billing dashboard
4. **Top up or upgrade** — Purchase additional credits or upgrade your plan when needed
