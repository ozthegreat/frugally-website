## What credits are

Credits are the billing unit consumed by frugally.app actions. Think of them as a universal currency for all the things frugally.app does on your behalf.

Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation that resets on the 1st of each month. Unused credits do not roll over.

## Credit allocation per plan

| Plan | Monthly credits | Additional credits |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Free** | 100 | Not available |
| **Pro** | 2,000 | Purchasable in packs |
| **Enterprise** | Custom (negotiated) | Included or purchasable |

## Upgrading and downgrading

### Upgrading

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Billing** > **Change Plan**
2. Select the target plan
3. Review the changes and confirm

Upgrades take effect immediately. Your credit balance is topped up to the new plan's allocation (pro-rated for the remaining days in the billing period).

### Downgrading

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Billing** > **Change Plan**
2. Select the target plan
3. Review the impact (features that will be lost)
4. Confirm the downgrade

Downgrades take effect at the start of the next billing period. You retain your current plan's features until then.

:::caution
Downgrading may disable features your team is actively using (e.g. Scopes, Guard, SSO). Review the impact carefully before confirming.

## Credit top-ups (Pro and Enterprise)

If you run out of credits before the month ends, Pro and Enterprise teams can purchase additional credits:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Billing** > **Buy Credits**
2. Select a credit pack
3. Confirm the purchase

Credits from top-ups are added immediately and do not expire until the end of the billing period.

For automatic top-ups, see [Auto Top-Up](./auto-top-up.md).
