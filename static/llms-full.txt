# Glossary

Key terms used throughout the frugally.app documentation.

---

### Connection

A link between frugally.app and an AWS account, established by deploying an IAM role. Connections can be set up individually (Standalone) or discovered automatically through an AWS Organisation.

> **Tip**
See [Connecting Your AWS Accounts](./getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts.md) for setup instructions.


---

### Target

A logical group of AWS resources to act on, defined by service type, regions, and tag filters. Targets are scoped to one or more Connections.

> **Tip**
See [Getting Started — Creating Targets](./getting-started/creating-targets.md).


---

### Execution

A single run of a Target's actions — stop, start, scale, or terminate. Executions can be triggered manually, by a Schedule, or as a dry run. Each Execution tracks per-resource results and a confidence score.

> **Tip**
See [Getting Started — Running an Execution](./getting-started/running-an-execution.md).


---

### Schedule

A time-based trigger linked to one or more Targets. Schedules support one-time runs, named patterns (weekdays only, nightly, etc.), and custom CRON expressions.

> **Tip**
See [Getting Started — Creating a Schedule](./getting-started/creating-a-schedule.md).


---

### Guard Project

A governance container for infrastructure change proposals. Each project has an intent (create, modify, optimise, or destroy), a list of affected resources, and a versioned approval workflow (Draft, Submitted, Approved/Rejected, Executed).

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Budget

A spending limit tracked against actual AWS costs, set at the project or team level. Budgets support threshold alerts at configurable percentages (e.g. 50%, 80%, 100%).

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Scope

A permission boundary that restricts what a user or Group can see and act on. Scopes come in three types — Environment, Connection, and Target — with the most specific match winning.

> **Tip**
See [Scopes](./roles-and-access/scopes.md) and [Groups](./roles-and-access/groups.md).


---

### Group

A collection of team members used for shared access (via Scopes) and notification policies. Groups can be managed manually, synced from Slack user groups (Pro), or provisioned via SCIM (Enterprise).

> **Tip**
See [Scopes](./roles-and-access/scopes.md) and [Groups](./roles-and-access/groups.md).


---

### Credit

The billing unit consumed by frugally.app actions. Each plan includes a monthly credit allocation; different actions consume different amounts depending on the AWS service and resource size.

> **Tip**
See [Billing](./category/billing).


---

### Violation

A detected breach of a budget, policy, or compliance rule. Violations have a severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and can be resolved manually or through auto-remediation.

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Scan

A periodic compliance check run by Guard. Scans evaluate your AWS environment against configured rules and produce Findings.

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Finding

A specific issue discovered during a Guard scan — for example, an untagged resource or an over-provisioned instance. Findings are linked to the scan that produced them.

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Cost Posture

A snapshot score representing your team's overall cost health. The posture score factors in waste, coverage, and optimisation opportunities, and is tracked over time to show trends.

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Maturity Assessment

A self-assessment of your team's FinOps practice maturity across dimensions such as visibility, optimisation, governance, and culture. Completing the assessment produces a score and an improvement path.

> **Tip**
Part of the **Guard** pillar.


---

### Drift

A mismatch between Infrastructure-as-Code definitions (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.) and the live state of AWS resources. Drift is detected by the GitHub integration and reported as alerts with severity levels.

> **Tip**
See [Getting Started — Connecting GitHub](./getting-started/connecting-github.md).

# Start Here

## What is frugally.app?

frugally.app is a shift-left FinOps platform. Connect your AWS accounts, group resources into Targets using tags, and schedule start/stop actions to cut costs automatically.

Beyond scheduling, frugally.app includes **Intelligence** to analyse your AWS spending and **Guard** to govern infrastructure changes with approval workflows, budgets, and compliance scanning.

Supported AWS services: **EC2**, **RDS**, **ECS**, **Auto Scaling Groups**, **EKS**, and **Redshift**.

## What you will set up

1. **[Connect your AWS accounts](connecting-your-aws-accounts.md)** — Link frugally.app to your AWS environment
2. **[Create Targets](creating-targets.md)** — Scan and group the resources you want to manage (the wizard can also suggest schedules)
3. **[Connect Slack](connecting-slack.md)** — Get notifications and quick actions in your workspace
4. **[Connect GitHub](connecting-github.md)** *(optional)* — Enable IaC scanning and drift detection
5. **[Run an Execution](running-an-execution.md)** — Test your setup with a manual one-off action
6. **[Create a Schedule](creating-a-schedule.md)** — Automate start/stop on a recurring basis

> **Prefer a guided setup?**
The **Target Onboarding Wizard** walks you through connecting an account, discovering resources, and creating your first Targets and Schedules in one flow. Look for the wizard prompt on the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app) after signing in.


## Prerequisites

- A frugally.app account ([sign in](https://dashboard.frugally.app))
- At least one AWS account
- AWS IAM permissions to create roles and policies
- *(Optional)* Slack workspace admin access
- *(Optional)* GitHub organisation admin access

## Key concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------:|
| **Connection** | A link between frugally.app and an AWS account via an IAM role. |
| **Target** | A logical group of AWS resources identified by service type, regions, and tags. |
| **Execution** | A one-off or scheduled action (start, stop, etc.) run against one or more Targets. |
| **Schedule** | A recurring rule that triggers Executions automatically on a timetable. |

For a full list of terms, see the [Glossary](../glossary.md).

> **Consistent tagging saves time**
Tag your AWS resources consistently — for example with `Environment` (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) or `schedule:true`. This makes it easy to create Targets and lets the Target Onboarding Wizard group resources for you automatically.


Ready? Let's start by [connecting your AWS accounts](connecting-your-aws-accounts.md).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts

# Connecting Your AWS Accounts

A **Connection** links frugally.app to one of your AWS accounts via an IAM role. Once connected, frugally.app can discover resources, run executions, and pull cost data.

There are two setup paths:

| Path | Best for | Guide |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Organisation Setup Wizard** | Multiple accounts under one AWS Organisation | [Organisation setup →](../connections/organisation-setup.md) |
| **Standalone Connection** | A single AWS account or a quick evaluation | [Standalone setup →](../connections/standalone-setup.md) |

---

## Quick start — Standalone Connection

If you have a single account and want the fastest path:

1. Create an IAM role in your AWS account — trusted account: `829513654501`, with an External ID from frugally.app.
2. Attach a policy granting the permissions frugally.app needs.
3. Fill in the [Add Connection form](https://dashboard.frugally.app/connections/create) with your Account ID, role name, and External ID.
4. Click **Save** — frugally.app verifies the connection automatically.

For the full walkthrough, see [Standalone setup](../connections/standalone-setup.md).

---

## Quick start — Organisation Setup

If you manage multiple accounts in an AWS Organisation:

1. Open the [Organisation Setup Wizard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/aws-organization-setup).
2. Enter your management account details and create the IAM role.
3. The wizard discovers member accounts — select which to onboard.
4. Generate and deploy IAM policies to each member account.
5. Confirm to create all Connections at once.

For the full walkthrough, see [Organisation setup](../connections/organisation-setup.md).

Next up: [Creating Targets](creating-targets.md) — scan your AWS accounts and group resources.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/creating-targets

# Creating Targets

A **Target** is a logical group of AWS resources identified by service type, regions, and tags. Targets are the building blocks for Executions and Schedules — every action you run in frugally.app is aimed at one or more Targets.

[View your Targets](https://dashboard.frugally.app/targets)

## Supported AWS services

| Service | Available actions |
|---------|------------------|
| **EC2** | Start, Stop |
| **RDS** | Start, Stop |
| **Lambda** | Enable, Disable |
| **ECS** | Scale Up, Scale Down |
| **NAT Gateway** | Create, Delete |
| **VPC Endpoint** | Enable, Disable |

> **Tag your resources consistently**
frugally.app works best when resources are tagged with `Environment` (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) and/or scheduling intent tags (e.g. `schedule:true`). Consistent tagging makes the Target Onboarding Wizard far more effective.


---

## Option A: Target Onboarding Wizard (Recommended)

The wizard scans your AWS accounts, automatically detects resources, groups them into recommended Targets based on tags, and suggests schedules — all in one guided flow. Scanning is read-only; nothing is created until you confirm.

[Open the Target Onboarding Wizard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/target-onboarding-wizard)

### Step 1 — Welcome

An overview of what the wizard does: read-only scanning, tag-based grouping, confidence scores, and production safety guardrails.


### Step 2 — Select Scope

Choose which **Connections**, **AWS regions** (max 10), and **services** (EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS, NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoint) to include in the scan.


### Step 3 — Scan & Discover

frugally.app scans your AWS accounts in parallel and lists all detected resources along with their tags.


### Step 4 — Review Recommendations

frugally.app groups resources into recommended Targets based on environment tags and scheduling intent tags. Each recommendation shows:

- **Name** (auto-generated, editable inline), service, region, and resource count
- **Confidence score** (High / Medium / Low) with expandable reasoning
- Non-production environments are pre-selected; production is flagged for caution
- Use the **Select All High Confidence** bulk action to speed things up


### Step 5 — Create Targets

Review your selected recommendations. Click **Create** and frugally.app creates the Target records.


### Step 6 — Schedule Suggestions

For each created Target, the wizard suggests a default schedule (weekdays 7 AM – 7 PM in the region's timezone). Non-production Targets are auto-selected; production Targets are not.


You can choose **Create Schedules & Finish** or **Skip Schedules & Finish**.

> **Note**
Schedules created here use sensible defaults. You can customise them later on the [Schedules page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules).


---

## Option B: Manual Target Creation

For creating individual Targets when you know exactly what you want.

[Create a Target manually](https://dashboard.frugally.app/targets/create)

Navigate to **Targets** > **Create Target** (or use the link above) and fill in the form:

- **Name** — A descriptive label (e.g. `Dev EC2 eu-west-1`)
- **Connections** — Select one or more Connections (multi-select)
- **Service Type** — The AWS service to manage
- **AWS Regions** — One or more regions (multi-select)
- **Tags** — Key:value pairs, one per line


### How tag filtering works

- `Environment:develop` + `Service:api` — **AND** logic: both tags must match
- `Environment:develop,staging` — **OR** logic for the same key: either value matches
- A key without a value matches all resources that have that tag key, regardless of value

For the full tag syntax reference, see [Resource Tag Filtering](../advanced/resource-tag-filtering.md).

### Verifying your Target

After saving, check the resource count on the Targets list. This shows how many AWS resources matched your filters.


> **0 resources found?**
Double-check your tag key/value pairs, selected regions, and that the IAM role in each AWS account has the correct permissions.

Next up: [Connecting Slack](connecting-slack.md) — set up notifications before you start running executions.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/connecting-slack

# Connecting Slack

The Slack integration gives you execution notifications, quick actions, and AI-powered natural-language queries directly in your workspace. It's optional but recommended — especially before creating schedules, so you can select a notification channel.

> **Note**
Slack is for **notifications, quick actions, and queries**. All management — creating Connections, Targets, and Schedules — is done on the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).


## Prerequisites

- Slack workspace admin access (to approve the app installation)
- A Slack channel for frugally.app notifications (e.g. `#cloud-ops`)

## Installing the Slack app

### 1. Open the Install page

Navigate to **Settings** > **Install Slack App** in the dashboard, or use the link below.

[Install Slack App](https://dashboard.frugally.app/install-slack-app)


### 2. Authorise in Slack

Click **Install to Slack**. Slack's OAuth screen shows the permissions frugally.app requests. Review and click **Allow**.


### 3. Confirm connection

You'll be redirected back to the dashboard. The status shows **Connected**.


## What you can do with Slack

- **Execution notifications** — Receive results in a Slack channel after every Execution
- **Quick actions** — Trigger Schedules and run Executions directly from Slack using slash commands (e.g. `/frugally run`, `/frugally status`)
- **AI-powered mentions** — Mention `@frugally` with a natural-language question ("Are we over budget?", "What happened last run?") and get an instant answer
- **Home Tab overview** — See upcoming Schedules, recent Executions, cost insights, and billing status from the Frugally Home Tab in Slack


## What Slack cannot do

Slack **cannot** create, edit, or delete Connections, Targets, or Schedules. It also cannot access Intelligence or Guard dashboards directly. All of these are managed via the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).

> **Tip**
You can skip this step and return later. Executions and Schedules work without Slack — results are always visible on the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions).


---

For a deeper look at slash commands, AI mentions, the Home Tab, and workflow integrations, see the **Integrations — Slack** section of the documentation.

Next up: [Connecting GitHub](connecting-github.md) *(optional)* or skip ahead to [Running an Execution](running-an-execution.md).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/connecting-github

# Connecting GitHub

The GitHub integration lets frugally.app scan your Infrastructure-as-Code repositories, detect drift between IaC definitions and live AWS resources, and add cost-impact comments to pull requests. It's optional but recommended if your team manages infrastructure through code.

> **Note**
GitHub is for **IaC scanning, drift detection, and PR reviews**. All core management — Connections, Targets, Schedules, and Guard — is done on the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).


## Prerequisites

- GitHub organisation admin access (to approve the app installation)
- At least one repository containing IaC files (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK, Pulumi, or OpenTofu)

## Installing the GitHub App

### 1. Open the Install page

Navigate to **Settings** > **Install GitHub App** in the dashboard, or use the link below.

[Install GitHub App](https://dashboard.frugally.app/github/install)


### 2. Authorise in GitHub

Click **Install GitHub App**. GitHub shows the permissions frugally.app requests — repository contents (read), pull requests (read/write), and issues (read). Select your organisation and choose which repositories to grant access to.

> **Tip**
You can grant access to **all repositories** or select specific ones. You can change this later from your GitHub organisation's Installed Apps settings.


### 3. Confirm connection

You'll be redirected back to the dashboard. The status shows **Connected** along with the repositories frugally.app can access.


## What you can do with GitHub

- **IaC scanning** — Automatically scan pull requests for Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK, Pulumi, and OpenTofu changes with cost-impact analysis
- **Drift detection** — Compare your IaC definitions against live AWS resource state and receive alerts when they diverge
- **PR cost-impact reviews** — Get automated comments on infrastructure PRs showing the estimated cost impact of proposed changes
- **Authorship tracking** — Track who changed what infrastructure for cost attribution in Guard

## What GitHub cannot do

GitHub **cannot** create, edit, or delete Connections, Targets, or Schedules. It also cannot manage budgets or approval workflows. All of these are managed via the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).

> **Tip**
You can skip this step and return later. Automations and Guard work without GitHub — the integration adds IaC-aware features on top.


---

For a deeper look at each GitHub feature, see the **Integrations — GitHub** section of the documentation.

Next up: [Running an Execution](running-an-execution.md) — test your setup with a manual action.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/running-an-execution

# Running an Execution

An Execution is a manual, one-time action against one or more Targets. Use it to test your setup or handle ad-hoc needs like starting a dev environment for weekend work.

[Run Now](https://dashboard.frugally.app/run-now)

## Running your first execution


Fill in the **Run Now** form:

- **Targets** — Select one or more Targets (multi-select)
- **Action** — Depends on the service type:
  - EC2 / RDS: **Start** or **Stop**
  - Lambda / VPC Endpoint: **Enable** or **Disable**
  - ECS: **Scale Up** or **Scale Down**
  - NAT Gateway: **Create** or **Delete**
- **Slack channel** *(optional)* — Where to post results

> **Note**
If Slack is not connected, the channel field won't appear. Results are always visible on the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions).


Click **Run** to start the execution.

## Viewing execution results

Open the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions) to see status and details for every execution.


If you selected a Slack channel, results are also posted there:


## Troubleshooting

- **No resources found** — Check that your Target's tags, regions, and service type match actual AWS resources.
- **Access denied** — Verify the IAM role name and External ID in your Connection match the role in AWS.
- **Resources not changing state** — Ensure the IAM policy includes the required actions (e.g. `ec2:StartInstances`, `ec2:StopInstances`). See the [Advanced IAM Policy](../advanced/iam-role-permissions.md) guide.

> **Tip**
It's safe to run against resources that are already in the desired state. frugally.app reports them as "already in target state" and takes no action.


---

Next up: [Creating a Schedule](creating-a-schedule.md) — automate your executions on a recurring basis.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule

# Creating a Schedule

Schedules automate your Executions. For example, turn off your dev environment at 7 PM every evening and start it again at 8 AM on weekdays — saving money overnight and on weekends without lifting a finger.

[View Schedules](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules)

> **Note**
If you used the Target Onboarding Wizard and created schedules in the final step, you may already have schedules. This page shows how to create and customise them.


## Creating your first schedule

Navigate to **Schedules** > **Create Schedule**, or use the link below.

[Create a Schedule](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules/create)


## The schedule form

The form has two tabs: **Stop (DOWN)** and **Start (UP)**, each with its own schedule settings.

- **Name** — A friendly label (e.g. `Dev Environment Weekdays`)
- **Targets** — Select one or more Targets (multi-select)
- **Timezone** — The timezone the schedule runs in (respects DST)
- **Slack Channel** *(optional)* — Where to post results when the schedule runs
- **Status** — Active or Inactive

## Choosing a schedule type

The guided schedule builder (default) lets you pick a frequency and set times using form fields — no CRON knowledge needed.

| Type | Use case | Fields |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Daily** | Same time every day | Time picker (default: 7 PM stop, 8 AM start) |
| **Weekly** | Specific days of the week | Day checkboxes (default: Mon–Fri) + time picker |
| **Monthly** | Specific day of the month or Nth weekday | Day selector or "2nd Tuesday" style picker + time picker |
| **Hourly** | Repeating every N hours | Interval (1–12 hrs) + minute offset + optional day selection |
| **One-time** | Run once at a specific date/time | Date picker + time picker |


> **Tip**
The most common setup is **Weekly, Mon–Fri**: stop at 7 PM and start at 8 AM. This keeps non-production resources off overnight and on weekends.


## Advanced: Custom CRON

For schedules that don't fit the guided types, switch to advanced mode and enter a raw CRON expression (`minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`).


Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build and validate your expression. For more details see the [Schedule Format Reference](../advanced/schedule-format.md).

> **Tip**
It's safe to set a stop schedule every evening as a safety net, even if resources are already off. frugally.app reports them as already in the desired state and takes no action.


## Viewing and managing schedules

After saving, your schedule appears in the list with a human-readable summary and next run times.


From this page you can edit, pause (set to Inactive), or delete a schedule. Results appear on the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions) and in Slack (if connected).

## Automate

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/overview

# Automate Overview

Automate is frugally.app's scheduling and resource management engine. It lets you define **what** to act on (Targets), **when** to act (Schedules), and tracks **every action** taken (Executions).

## How Automate works

The Automate workflow follows three core concepts:

```
Targets  →  Schedules  →  Executions
(what)      (when)        (track)
```

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **[Targets](./targets/overview.md)** | Group AWS resources by service, region, and tags | "All EC2 instances tagged `env=dev` in eu-west-1" |
| **[Schedules](./schedules/overview.md)** | Define when Targets should be stopped, started, or scaled | "Stop at 7 PM weekdays, start at 8 AM weekdays" |
| **[Executions](./executions/overview.md)** | Record every action with per-resource results and confidence scores | "Stopped 12 EC2 instances — 11 succeeded, 1 already stopped" |

---

## Supported AWS services

Automate currently supports six AWS services:

| Service | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| **EC2** | Start, Stop |
| **RDS** | Start, Stop |
| **ECS** | Scale Up, Scale Down |
| **Lambda** | Enable, Disable |
| **NAT Gateway** | Create, Delete |
| **VPC Endpoint** | Enable, Disable |

For per-service details and IAM requirements, see [Supported Services](./targets/supported-services.md).

---

## Getting started with Automate

If you are new to frugally.app, the quickest path is:

1. **[Connect your AWS accounts](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts)** — Establish the IAM link
2. **Use the [Onboarding Wizard](./onboarding-wizard.md)** — Scan resources, create Targets, and set up Schedules in one guided flow
3. **Review your [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard/overview)** — Monitor savings and execution results

For hands-on control, you can also create [Targets](./targets/overview.md) and [Schedules](./schedules/overview.md) manually.

---

## Key sections

| Section | Pages | What you will learn |

# Onboarding Wizard

The Target Onboarding Wizard is a guided flow that scans your AWS accounts, discovers resources, groups them into recommended Targets, and optionally creates Schedules — all in one session. It is the fastest way to go from a connected AWS account to active cost savings.

[Open the Onboarding Wizard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/target-onboarding-wizard)

> **Tip**
The wizard is read-only during scanning. Nothing is created in AWS or frugally.app until you explicitly confirm at the creation step.


---

## When to use the wizard

- **New to frugally.app** — The wizard handles discovery and setup in one flow, so you do not need to create Targets and Schedules manually
- **Adding a new AWS account** — After connecting an account, run the wizard to discover and group its resources
- **Periodic review** — Re-run the wizard to pick up new resources that have been launched since your last scan

For creating individual Targets with precise control, see [Creating Targets](/docs/getting-started/creating-targets#option-b-manual-target-creation).

---

## Wizard steps

### Step 1 — Welcome

An introduction explaining what the wizard does: read-only scanning, tag-based grouping, confidence scores, and production safety guardrails.


### Step 2 — Select Scope

Choose which **Connections**, **AWS regions** (up to 10), and **services** (EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS, NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoint) to include in the scan.


> **Note**
The wizard only scans regions and services you select. If you have resources in regions not selected here, they will not appear in the results.


### Step 3 — Scan and Discover

frugally.app scans your AWS accounts in parallel and lists all detected resources along with their tags. The scan is read-only — no changes are made to your AWS environment.


### Step 4 — Review Recommendations

frugally.app groups discovered resources into recommended Targets based on environment tags and scheduling intent tags. Each recommendation shows:

- **Name** — Auto-generated and editable inline
- **Service, region, and resource count**
- **Confidence score** (High, Medium, or Low) with expandable reasoning
- **Production flag** — Production environments are flagged for caution and not pre-selected

Use the **Select All High Confidence** bulk action to quickly accept the best recommendations.


For more on how confidence scores work, see [Confidence Scoring](./executions/confidence-scoring.md).

### Step 5 — Create Targets

Review your selected recommendations. Click **Create** and frugally.app creates the Target records. You can still go back and adjust selections before confirming.


### Step 6 — Schedule Suggestions

For each created Target, the wizard suggests a default Schedule (weekdays 7 AM – 7 PM in the region's timezone). Non-production Targets are auto-selected; production Targets are not.


You can choose:
- **Create Schedules & Finish** — Accept the suggested Schedules and complete setup
- **Skip Schedules & Finish** — Create only the Targets and set up Schedules later

> **Note**
Schedules created by the wizard use sensible defaults. You can customise them at any time on the [Schedules page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules). See [CRON and Schedule Types](./schedules/cron-and-schedule-types.md) for all available options.


---

## How the wizard relates to manual setup

The wizard automates the same steps described in the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/start-here) guide:

| Wizard step | Manual equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Select Scope | Choose Connections, regions, and services on the Target creation form |
| Scan and Discover | Browse your AWS console or use tag explorer |
| Review Recommendations | Decide which resources to group into Targets |
| Create Targets | [Create Targets manually](/docs/getting-started/creating-targets#option-b-manual-target-creation) |
| Schedule Suggestions | [Create Schedules manually](/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule) |

---

## After the wizard

Once the wizard is complete:

- Check the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard/overview) to see your new Targets and Schedules
- Review the [Onboarding Checklist](/docs/dashboard/onboarding-checklist) to see which setup steps remain
- Monitor [Execution results](./executions/overview.md) as your Schedules begin running

# Targets Overview

A **Target** is a logical group of AWS resources that frugally.app can act on. Targets are defined by service type, AWS regions, and tag filters, and are scoped to one or more [Connections](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts).

Targets are the foundation of Automate — every [Schedule](../schedules/overview.md) and [Execution](../executions/overview.md) runs against one or more Targets.

[View your Targets](https://dashboard.frugally.app/targets)

---

## How Targets relate to other concepts

```
Connections → Targets → Schedules → Executions
(AWS accounts)  (resource groups)  (time triggers)  (actions taken)
```

- A Target is scoped to one or more **Connections** (AWS accounts)
- A Target selects resources by **service type**, **regions**, and **tags**
- **Schedules** reference Targets to know which resources to act on
- **Executions** record the results of actions taken against a Target's resources

---

## Creating Targets

There are two ways to create Targets:

| Method | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **[Onboarding Wizard](../onboarding-wizard.md)** | New teams or bulk discovery — scans AWS accounts and recommends Targets automatically |
| **[Manual creation](/docs/getting-started/creating-targets#option-b-manual-target-creation)** | Precise control when you know exactly which resources to group |

---

## Target configuration

Every Target has the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive label (e.g. `Dev EC2 eu-west-1`) |
| **Connections** | One or more linked AWS accounts |
| **Service type** | The AWS service to manage (EC2, RDS, ECS, Lambda, NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoint) |
| **Regions** | One or more AWS regions |
| **Tags** | Key:value pairs used to filter resources |

---

## Resource matching

When a Target is saved, frugally.app queries your AWS accounts and counts the number of resources that match the Target's filters. This count is displayed on the Targets list page.


> **0 resources matched?**
Double-check your tag key/value pairs, selected regions, and that the IAM role in each Connection has the correct permissions. See [IAM Role Permissions](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions) for the required policy.

# Supported Services

frugally.app supports six AWS services for automation. Each service has specific actions available and requires corresponding IAM permissions on the Connection's role.

---

## Service reference

| Service | Actions | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **EC2** | Start, Stop | Applies to instances only (not Spot or scheduled instances). Stopped instances retain their EBS volumes and Elastic IPs. |
| **RDS** | Start, Stop | Applies to DB instances and Multi-AZ deployments. Aurora clusters should be managed via the cluster endpoint. RDS instances cannot remain stopped for more than 7 days (AWS will auto-restart them). |
| **ECS** | Scale Up, Scale Down | Adjusts the desired task count on ECS services. Scale Down sets the count to 0; Scale Up restores it to the previously recorded count. |
| **Lambda** | Enable, Disable | Disables or enables event source mappings and triggers. The function itself is not deleted. |
| **NAT Gateway** | Create, Delete | Deletes NAT Gateways to eliminate hourly charges. Create restores them with the same configuration. Elastic IPs are preserved. |
| **VPC Endpoint** | Enable, Disable | Disables interface VPC endpoints to stop hourly charges. Gateway endpoints (S3, DynamoDB) are not charged and are excluded. |

---

## IAM permissions per service

Each service requires specific IAM actions on the Connection's role. The table below lists the minimum required permissions.

### EC2

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
    "ec2:StartInstances",
    "ec2:StopInstances"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### RDS

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
    "rds:StartDBInstance",
    "rds:StopDBInstance"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### ECS

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ecs:DescribeServices",
    "ecs:UpdateService",
    "ecs:ListServices",
    "ecs:ListClusters"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Lambda

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "lambda:ListFunctions",
    "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings",
    "lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping",
    "lambda:GetFunction"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### NAT Gateway

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DescribeNatGateways",
    "ec2:CreateNatGateway",
    "ec2:DeleteNatGateway",
    "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
    "ec2:AllocateAddress",
    "ec2:AssociateAddress"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### VPC Endpoint

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints",
    "ec2:ModifyVpcEndpoint"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

> **Tip**
For a complete IAM policy covering all services, see [IAM Role Permissions](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions). You can also restrict permissions to specific resources using tag-based conditions — see [Resource Tag Filtering](/docs/advanced/resource-tag-filtering).


---

## Service-specific caveats

### RDS 7-day stop limit

AWS automatically restarts RDS instances that have been stopped for 7 consecutive days. frugally.app accounts for this by re-issuing the stop command on the next Schedule run. If you see an RDS instance temporarily running between Schedule cycles, this is expected behaviour.

### ECS task count persistence

When frugally.app scales an ECS service down to 0, it records the original desired task count. On Scale Up, it restores the service to that recorded count. If you manually change the desired count while the service is scaled down, the manual change takes precedence on the next Scale Up.

### NAT Gateway recreation

Deleting a NAT Gateway releases its private IP. When frugally.app recreates the NAT Gateway, it receives a new private IP. The Elastic IP is preserved and re-associated. Update any route tables that reference the NAT Gateway ID, as the ID will change on recreation.

> **Note**
If your workloads depend on a stable NAT Gateway ID (e.g. in route table references), consider using Schedules only during predictable downtime windows and verify routing after recreation.

# Tag Filtering

Tag filtering lets you precisely select which AWS resources a Target should include. Instead of managing individual resources, you define tag rules and frugally.app automatically matches current and future resources that satisfy those rules.

---

## How tag filtering works

When you create or edit a Target, you specify one or more tag key:value pairs. frugally.app queries AWS for resources of the selected service type in the selected regions and returns only those that match your tag filters.

Tag filters are evaluated each time a Schedule runs or an Execution is triggered, so if you add a new resource with matching tags, it is automatically included in the next run.

---

## Syntax

Tags are specified as `Key:Value` pairs, one per line in the Target configuration form.

### Basic examples

| Tag filter | Matches |
|-----------|---------|
| `Environment:dev` | Resources tagged with `Environment` = `dev` |
| `schedule:true` | Resources tagged with `schedule` = `true` |
| `Environment` | Resources that have the `Environment` tag key, regardless of value |

---

## Combining filters

### AND logic (multiple keys)

When you specify multiple tag keys, **all** must match (AND logic):

```
Environment:dev
Team:backend
```

This matches resources tagged with **both** `Environment=dev` **and** `Team=backend`.

### OR logic (multiple values for one key)

When you specify multiple values for the same key, **any** value can match (OR logic):

```
Environment:dev,staging
```

This matches resources tagged with `Environment=dev` **or** `Environment=staging`.

### Combining AND and OR

```
Environment:dev,staging
Team:backend
```

This matches resources where `Environment` is `dev` or `staging` **AND** `Team` is `backend`.

---

## Key-only matching

Specifying a key without a value matches all resources that have that tag key, regardless of its value:

```
schedule
```

This matches any resource with a `schedule` tag, whether its value is `true`, `false`, `weekdays`, or anything else.

---

## Tag matching rules

| Rule | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Tag keys are **case-sensitive** | `Environment` and `environment` are different keys |
| Tag values are **case-sensitive** | `Dev` and `dev` are different values |
| Leading/trailing whitespace is **trimmed** | `  dev  ` is treated as `dev` |
| Empty value with colon (`Key:`) | Matches resources where the tag key exists with an empty string value |

---

## Tips for effective tagging

> **Consistent tagging saves time**
Tag your AWS resources consistently — for example with `Environment` (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) or `schedule:true`. This makes it easy to create Targets and lets the [Onboarding Wizard](../onboarding-wizard.md) group resources for you automatically.


- **Use a tagging standard** — Agree on tag keys and allowed values across your team (e.g. always `Environment`, never `Env` or `env`)
- **Tag at launch** — Apply tags when creating resources to ensure they are picked up immediately
- **Audit regularly** — Untagged resources will not be matched by any Target

---

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/targets/dry-runs

# Dry Runs

A dry run lets you preview what an Execution would do without actually changing any resources. It is the safest way to validate your Target configuration before scheduling real actions.

---

## What a dry run does

When you trigger a dry run, frugally.app:

1. Queries your AWS accounts using the Target's filters (service, regions, tags)
2. Lists all matched resources and the action that **would** be taken on each
3. Reports the current state of each resource (e.g. running, stopped)
4. Calculates what the outcome **would** be (e.g. "would stop", "already stopped")

No changes are made to your AWS environment. Dry runs are completely read-only.

---

## When to use dry runs

| Scenario | Why a dry run helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **New Target** | Verify that the right resources are matched before creating a Schedule |
| **Changed tags** | Confirm that updated tag filters still select the intended resources |
| **Pre-production check** | Validate a Target before attaching it to a live Schedule |
| **Debugging** | Investigate why an Execution produced unexpected results |

---

## How to trigger a dry run

### From the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Targets** and select a Target
2. Click **Dry Run** in the Target detail view
3. Choose the action to simulate (e.g. Stop, Start)
4. Review the results


### From Slack

Use the `/frugally dry-run` command:

```
/frugally dry-run <target-name> <action>
```

For example:

```
/frugally dry-run "Dev EC2 eu-west-1" stop
```

The results are posted to the channel where you ran the command.

---

## Reading dry run results

The results show a table of matched resources with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Resource** | Resource ID and name tag (if available) |
| **Current state** | The resource's current state (e.g. running, stopped, active) |
| **Planned action** | What the Execution would do (e.g. "Would stop", "Already stopped — no action") |
| **Service** | AWS service type |
| **Region** | AWS region |


> **Tip**
Resources already in the desired state are marked as "no action". This is normal — frugally.app never takes action on resources that are already in the target state, even in real Executions.


---

## Dry runs vs real Executions

| Aspect | Dry run | Real Execution |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Changes AWS resources | No | Yes |
| Recorded in Execution history | Yes (marked as dry run) | Yes |
| Counts towards credits | No | Yes |
| Can be triggered from Slack | Yes | Yes |
| Shows matched resources | Yes | Yes |
| Shows confidence score | Yes | Yes |

---

## Next steps

Once your dry run confirms the right resources are matched, you can:

- [Run a manual Execution](../executions/manual-executions.md) to take action immediately
- [Create a Schedule](../schedules/overview.md) to automate the action on a recurring basis


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/schedules/overview

# Schedules Overview

A **Schedule** is a time-based trigger linked to one or more [Targets](../targets/overview.md). Schedules tell frugally.app **when** to run actions against your AWS resources — stop them in the evening, start them in the morning, scale down over the weekend, and so on.

[View your Schedules](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules)

---

## How Schedules work

Each Schedule defines:

- **Which Targets** to act on
- **What action** to take (Stop/Start, Scale Down/Up, Enable/Disable, Create/Delete)
- **When** to run (daily, weekly, monthly, hourly, one-time, or custom CRON)
- **What timezone** to use
- **Where to notify** (optional Slack channel)

When a Schedule's time arrives, frugally.app creates an [Execution](../executions/overview.md) for each linked Target and carries out the configured action.

---

## Schedule structure

Most Schedules come in pairs — a **Stop (DOWN)** schedule and a **Start (UP)** schedule:

| Schedule | Purpose | Example time |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Stop (DOWN)** | Shut down or scale down resources | 7:00 PM weekdays |
| **Start (UP)** | Bring resources back up | 8:00 AM weekdays |

This pair ensures resources are off during non-working hours and available when your team needs them.

> **Tip**
You do not need to create both. A Stop-only schedule is useful as a safety net to catch resources left running accidentally.


---

## Schedule states

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Active** | The Schedule will trigger at its next scheduled time |
| **Inactive** | The Schedule is paused and will not trigger until reactivated |

You can toggle a Schedule between Active and Inactive at any time from the Schedules list page without deleting it.

---

## Creating Schedules

There are three ways to create Schedules:

| Method | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **[Onboarding Wizard](../onboarding-wizard.md)** | Bulk creation during initial setup — suggests Schedules for each Target |
| **[Guided form](/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule)** | Creating individual Schedules with a visual form (no CRON knowledge needed) |
| **[Custom CRON](./cron-and-schedule-types.md)** | Advanced patterns that the guided form does not cover |

---

## In this section

- **[CRON and Schedule Types](./cron-and-schedule-types.md)** — All available schedule types, CRON syntax, and timezone handling
- **[Estimated Savings](./estimated-savings.md)** — How frugally.app calculates savings before a Schedule runs


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/schedules/cron-and-schedule-types

# CRON and Schedule Types

frugally.app supports two ways to define when a Schedule runs: a **guided schedule builder** with preset types, and a **custom CRON** mode for advanced patterns.

---

## Guided schedule types

The guided builder (default) lets you pick a frequency and set times using form fields — no CRON knowledge needed.

| Type | Use case | Fields |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Daily** | Same time every day | Time picker |
| **Weekly** | Specific days of the week | Day checkboxes + time picker |
| **Monthly** | Specific day of the month or Nth weekday | Day selector or "2nd Tuesday" style picker + time picker |
| **Hourly** | Repeating every N hours | Interval (1–12 hours) + minute offset + optional day selection |
| **One-time** | Run once at a specific date and time | Date picker + time picker |

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Type | Configuration |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Stop dev every evening | Weekly | Mon–Fri, 7:00 PM |
| Start dev every morning | Weekly | Mon–Fri, 8:00 AM |
| Stop all non-prod on Friday evening | Weekly | Fri, 6:00 PM |
| Start all non-prod on Monday morning | Weekly | Mon, 8:00 AM |
| Nightly safety-net stop | Daily | 11:00 PM |
| Scale down ECS overnight | Daily | 10:00 PM |

> **Tip**
The most common setup is **Weekly, Mon–Fri**: stop at 7 PM and start at 8 AM. This keeps non-production resources off overnight and on weekends — typically saving 65–75% on those resources.


---

## Custom CRON expressions

For patterns that the guided builder cannot express, switch to advanced mode and enter a raw CRON expression.

### CRON syntax

frugally.app uses standard 5-field CRON syntax:

```
┌───────────── minute (0–59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1–31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12 or JAN–DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0–6 or SUN–SAT, where 0 = Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Supported operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `*` | Every value | `* * * * *` = every minute |
| `,` | List | `1,15 * * * *` = minute 1 and 15 |
| `-` | Range | `0 9-17 * * *` = every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM |
| `/` | Step | `*/15 * * * *` = every 15 minutes |

### CRON examples

| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0 19 * * 1-5` | 7:00 PM, Monday to Friday |
| `0 8 * * 1-5` | 8:00 AM, Monday to Friday |
| `0 23 * * *` | 11:00 PM every day |
| `0 6 * * 1` | 6:00 AM every Monday |
| `0 0 1 * *` | Midnight on the 1st of each month |
| `0 */2 * * 1-5` | Every 2 hours, Monday to Friday |

> **Note**
Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build and validate your CRON expressions. For the complete syntax reference, see [Schedule Format](/docs/advanced/schedule-format).


---

## Timezone handling

All Schedules run in the timezone you select when creating them. frugally.app automatically adjusts for **Daylight Saving Time** (DST) transitions.

| Behaviour | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **DST spring forward** | If the scheduled time falls in the skipped hour, the Execution runs at the next valid minute |
| **DST fall back** | If the scheduled time falls in the repeated hour, the Execution runs once (on the first occurrence) |
| **UTC option** | Select UTC if you prefer a fixed offset with no DST adjustments |

> **Tip**
Choose the timezone that matches your team's working hours. If your team spans multiple timezones, consider creating separate Schedules per region.


---

## Editing schedule types

You can switch between guided and CRON modes when editing an existing Schedule. Switching from guided to CRON preserves the current timing as a CRON expression. Switching from CRON to guided is only possible if the expression maps to a supported guided type.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/schedules/estimated-savings

# Estimated Savings

Before a Schedule runs, frugally.app calculates an estimated savings figure based on the Target's resources, their hourly costs, and the Schedule's timing. This helps you understand the potential value of your automation before any action is taken.

---

## How estimates are calculated

The estimated savings formula is:

```
Estimated savings = Resource count × Hourly cost × Hours stopped per cycle
```

| Factor | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **Resource count** | The number of AWS resources currently matched by the Target's filters |
| **Hourly cost** | The on-demand rate for each resource type and size (e.g. a `t3.medium` EC2 instance in eu-west-1) |
| **Hours stopped per cycle** | Derived from the Schedule's stop and start times |

### Example

A Target contains 10 EC2 `t3.medium` instances at $0.0416/hr each. The Schedule stops them at 7 PM and starts them at 8 AM on weekdays (13 hours stopped per night, 5 nights per week = 65 hours/week).

```
10 × $0.0416 × 65 = $27.04 per week
```

Projected monthly savings: approximately **$108**.

---

## Where estimates are shown

| Location | What you see |
|----------|--------------|
| **Schedule detail page** | Estimated savings per cycle and per month |
| **Schedules list** | Estimated monthly savings column |
| **Dashboard** | Aggregated projected savings across all active Schedules |
| **Onboarding Wizard** | Per-Target savings estimate at the Schedule suggestion step |

---

## Factors that affect accuracy

Estimates are projections based on current data. Several factors can cause actual savings to differ:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** | On-demand pricing is used for estimates; actual costs may be lower if resources are covered by commitments |
| **Resource changes** | If resources are added to or removed from the Target between estimate and execution, the actual count will differ |
| **Execution failures** | If an Execution fails to stop some resources, those resources continue running and the savings are not realised |
| **Manual interventions** | Resources started manually outside of frugally.app reduce actual savings |
| **Already-stopped resources** | Resources already in the desired state yield no additional savings |

> **Note**
Estimates use on-demand pricing as the baseline. If a significant portion of your resources are covered by Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, the actual cost-avoidance will be lower than the estimate — but you are still avoiding unnecessary usage of those commitments.


---

## Estimates vs actuals

To compare estimated savings against actual results over time, see the [Projected vs Actual Savings](/docs/dashboard/projected-vs-actual-savings) chart on the Dashboard.

For detailed execution-level results, see [Execution Lifecycle](../executions/execution-lifecycle.md).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/executions/overview

# Executions Overview

An **Execution** is a single run of actions against one or more [Targets](../targets/overview.md). Every time frugally.app stops, starts, or scales your AWS resources — whether triggered by a [Schedule](../schedules/overview.md), run manually, or performed as a dry run — it creates an Execution record.

[View Executions](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions)

---

## Execution types

| Type | Trigger | Changes resources? |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Scheduled** | A Schedule reaches its configured time | Yes |
| **Manual** | A user clicks **Run Now** or uses a Slack command | Yes |
| **Dry run** | A user triggers a dry run from the UI or Slack | No — preview only |

---

## Execution summary

The Executions page shows a list of all Executions with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Status** | Current lifecycle state (Queued, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Partially Failed) |
| **Target** | The Target(s) acted upon |
| **Action** | The action taken (Stop, Start, Scale Up, etc.) |
| **Resources** | Count of resources acted on and their outcomes |
| **Confidence** | The confidence score for this Execution |
| **Triggered by** | Schedule name, user name, or "Dry run" |
| **Started at** | When the Execution began |
| **Duration** | How long the Execution took to complete |


---

## Execution detail

Click any Execution to see its full detail, including:

- Per-resource results (succeeded, failed, already in target state)
- Error messages for any failed resources
- Timestamps for each lifecycle stage
- Confidence score breakdown
- Slack notification status (if a channel was configured)

- **[Execution Lifecycle](./execution-lifecycle.md)** — The stages an Execution goes through from start to finish
- **[Confidence Scoring](./confidence-scoring.md)** — How confidence scores are calculated and what they mean


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/executions/manual-executions

# Manual Executions

A manual Execution lets you run an action against one or more Targets immediately, without waiting for a Schedule. Use it to test your setup, handle ad-hoc needs, or respond to unexpected situations.

---

## When to use manual Executions

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Testing a new Target** | Run a Stop action manually to verify the right resources are matched before creating a Schedule |
| **Ad-hoc shutdown** | Shut down dev environments before a holiday without modifying your regular Schedule |
| **Emergency response** | Scale down resources immediately in response to a cost anomaly |
| **Weekend work** | Start resources that are normally off on weekends for a one-time work session |

---

## Running from the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Run Now** or click the **Run Now** button on the Targets page

   [Run Now](https://dashboard.frugally.app/run-now)

2. Fill in the form:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Targets** | Select one or more Targets (multi-select) |
   | **Action** | Depends on the service type — Stop/Start, Scale Up/Down, Enable/Disable, Create/Delete |
   | **Slack channel** *(optional)* | Where to post results |

3. Click **Run** to start the Execution


> **Note**
If Slack is not connected, the channel field will not appear. Results are always visible on the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions).


---

## Running from Slack

Use the `/frugally run` slash command to trigger a manual Execution directly from Slack:

```
/frugally run <target-name> <action>
```

### Examples

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/frugally run "Dev EC2 eu-west-1" stop` | Stops all resources in the "Dev EC2 eu-west-1" Target |
| `/frugally run "Staging RDS" start` | Starts all resources in the "Staging RDS" Target |
| `/frugally run "Dev ECS" scale-down` | Scales down all ECS services in the "Dev ECS" Target |

Results are posted to the channel where you ran the command.

> **Tip**
Use double quotes around Target names that contain spaces.


---

## Viewing results

After triggering a manual Execution, you can track its progress in two places:

1. **[Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions)** — Full detail with per-resource results
2. **Slack** — Summary posted to the selected channel (if configured)

Manual Executions follow the same [lifecycle stages](./execution-lifecycle.md) as scheduled Executions.

---

## Manual Executions and credits

Manual Executions consume [credits](/docs/category/billing) just like scheduled Executions. [Dry runs](../targets/dry-runs.md) do not consume credits and are a good way to validate before running a real Execution.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/executions/execution-lifecycle

# Execution Lifecycle

Every Execution moves through a series of stages from creation to completion. Understanding the lifecycle helps you monitor progress, diagnose failures, and know what to expect when an Execution runs.

---

## Lifecycle stages

```
Queued → Running → Succeeded / Failed / Partially Failed
```

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Queued** | The Execution has been created and is waiting to be processed. This is typically brief (seconds). |
| **Running** | frugally.app is actively calling AWS APIs to perform the action on each resource in the Target. |
| **Succeeded** | All resources in the Target transitioned to the desired state. |
| **Failed** | No resources transitioned — the Execution encountered an error that prevented all actions. |
| **Partially Failed** | Some resources transitioned successfully, but one or more encountered errors. |


---

## What happens at each stage

### Queued

The Execution is created and placed in the processing queue. This happens when:
- A Schedule's time arrives
- A user clicks **Run Now**
- A user triggers an Execution via Slack

Executions are typically picked up within seconds. If the queue is busy, this stage may last longer.

### Running

frugally.app makes AWS API calls for each resource in the Target:

1. **Describe** — Queries the current state of each resource
2. **Filter** — Skips resources already in the desired state
3. **Act** — Calls the appropriate AWS API (e.g. `ec2:StopInstances`)
4. **Verify** — Confirms the state change (with polling for services that are not instant)

Resources are processed in parallel where possible to minimise Execution duration.

### Succeeded

All resources reached the desired state. The Execution detail shows:
- Each resource with a green status indicator
- Total savings for this Execution (calculated from hourly cost × duration)
- Confidence score

### Failed

No resources could be acted on. Common causes:

| Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| **IAM permission denied** | Update the Connection's IAM role — see [IAM Role Permissions](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions) |
| **Connection unhealthy** | Check the Connection status in [Connections](https://dashboard.frugally.app/connections) |
| **Service quota exceeded** | Check AWS service quotas for the affected region |
| **AWS API error** | Transient error — the next scheduled run will retry automatically |

### Partially Failed

Some resources succeeded, others did not. The Execution detail shows per-resource results so you can identify which resources failed and why.

> **Tip**
Partially failed Executions are common when a Target spans multiple AWS accounts or regions. One account may have permission issues while others work fine. Review the per-resource errors to pinpoint the issue.


---

## Retry behaviour

frugally.app does not automatically retry failed Executions within the same cycle. However:

- **Scheduled Executions** will naturally retry at the next Schedule interval
- **Manual Executions** can be re-triggered by the user from the Run Now page
- **Transient AWS errors** (throttling, temporary service issues) are handled with exponential backoff during the Running stage

---

## Execution duration

Execution duration depends on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Resource count** | More resources = longer Execution |
| **Service type** | Some AWS APIs respond faster than others |
| **AWS API throttling** | Large batches may be rate-limited by AWS |
| **State verification** | Some services (e.g. RDS) take longer to confirm state changes |

Most Executions complete within 1–5 minutes. Large Targets (100+ resources) may take longer.

---

## Viewing lifecycle details

The Execution detail page shows:

- **Timeline** — Timestamps for each lifecycle stage
- **Per-resource results** — Status, action taken, and any error messages
- **Confidence score** — See [Confidence Scoring](./confidence-scoring.md)
- **Slack notification** — Whether the results were posted to Slack and which channel


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/automate/executions/confidence-scoring

# Confidence Scoring

Every Execution in frugally.app receives a **confidence score** — a value from 0 to 100 that indicates how reliably the Execution is expected to achieve its goal. Higher scores mean greater confidence that the right resources will be acted on successfully.

---

## What the confidence score represents

The confidence score is a composite metric that considers multiple factors about the Target, its resources, and historical performance. It answers the question: "How confident is frugally.app that this Execution will do what you expect?"

| Score range | Label | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **80–100** | High | Strong resource match, good historical success, well-configured Target |
| **50–79** | Medium | Likely to succeed but some factors could be improved |
| **0–49** | Low | Significant risk of unexpected results — review before scheduling |

---

## Scoring factors

The confidence score is calculated from the following factors:

### Resource match quality

How well the Target's filters match the intended resources.

| Signal | Positive impact | Negative impact |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Tag coverage** | All matched resources have the expected tags | Resources matched by broad filters (e.g. no tags, region-only) |
| **Resource count stability** | Consistent count across recent scans | Count fluctuates significantly between scans |
| **Service type match** | Resources are the expected type and size | Mixed resource types that may behave differently |

### Historical success rate

How often previous Executions against this Target have succeeded.

| Signal | Positive impact | Negative impact |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Past success rate** | 90%+ Executions succeeded fully | Frequent partial failures or full failures |
| **Consistency** | Results are predictable across runs | Inconsistent outcomes (some runs succeed, others fail) |
| **Recency** | Recent Executions succeeded | Last few Executions had issues |

### Configuration completeness

How well the Target and its associated resources are configured.

| Signal | Positive impact | Negative impact |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **IAM permissions** | All required permissions are in place | Missing or outdated IAM policies |
| **Connection health** | All linked Connections are healthy | One or more Connections have issues |
| **Tag specificity** | Filters use specific key:value pairs | Filters are overly broad (key-only or no tags) |

---

## Where confidence scores are displayed

| Location | Detail shown |
|----------|-------------|
| **Execution detail page** | Full score with per-factor breakdown |
| **Executions list** | Score badge (High / Medium / Low) |
| **Onboarding Wizard** | Per-recommendation score at the review step |
| **Slack notifications** | Score included in Execution result messages |
| **Dry run results** | Score for the simulated Execution |


---

## How to improve a low score

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Low tag coverage** | Add specific tags to your AWS resources and update the Target's tag filters |
| **Fluctuating resource count** | Investigate why resources are being created/destroyed — consider more specific filters |
| **Low historical success rate** | Review failed Executions for error patterns — often an IAM or connectivity issue |
| **Broad filters** | Narrow your Target's filters with additional tag key:value pairs |
| **Unhealthy Connection** | Check the Connection status and update the IAM role if needed |

> **Tip**
A confidence score below 50 does not prevent an Execution from running. It is an advisory signal to help you prioritise which Targets to review and improve. Running a [dry run](../targets/dry-runs.md) is a safe way to investigate before taking action.


---

## Confidence scores and the Onboarding Wizard

The [Onboarding Wizard](../onboarding-wizard.md) uses confidence scores to rank its Target recommendations. The **Select All High Confidence** button selects only recommendations with a score of 80 or above, ensuring your initial setup starts with the most reliable Targets.

# Automate Insights

The Insights dashboard provides analytics on your Automate activity — savings over time, execution success rates, and resource coverage. Use it to understand the impact of your automation and identify opportunities for improvement.

[View Insights](https://dashboard.frugally.app/insights)


---

## Key metrics

### Savings over time

A chart showing total savings broken down by period. Savings are calculated from completed Executions where resources were successfully stopped or scaled down.

| Granularity | Available ranges |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Daily** | Last 7 days, last 30 days |
| **Weekly** | Last 4 weeks, last 12 weeks |
| **Monthly** | Last 3 months, last 6 months, last 12 months |

### Execution success rate

The percentage of Executions that completed without errors, shown as a trend line alongside total Execution count. A high success rate indicates healthy Targets and IAM configurations.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Succeeded** | All resources in the Target transitioned to the desired state |
| **Partially failed** | Some resources transitioned; others encountered errors |
| **Failed** | No resources transitioned — typically an IAM or connectivity issue |

> **Tip**
If your success rate drops below 90%, review the [Execution Lifecycle](./executions/execution-lifecycle.md) page for troubleshooting guidance, and check that your IAM policies are up to date in [IAM Role Permissions](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions).


### Resource coverage

Shows how many of your AWS resources are included in at least one Target, compared to the total discovered resources across your Connections. High coverage means more of your environment is being managed by frugally.app.

---

## Filters and controls

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Date range** | Preset ranges or custom date picker |
| **Connection** | Filter by one or more AWS Connections |
| **Service** | Filter by AWS service type |
| **Target** | Filter by specific Targets |

---

## Using Insights to improve savings

1. **Low resource coverage?** Run the [Onboarding Wizard](./onboarding-wizard.md) to discover resources not yet included in Targets
2. **Low success rate?** Check for IAM permission errors or resources that have been terminated in AWS
3. **Savings plateau?** Review your [Schedules](./schedules/overview.md) — extending stop durations (e.g. including weekends) or adding more Targets can increase savings
4. **Projected vs actual gap?** See the [Projected vs Actual Savings](/docs/dashboard/projected-vs-actual-savings) chart for a detailed comparison

## Intelligence

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/intelligence/overview

# Intelligence Overview

Intelligence is frugally.app's AWS billing analysis pillar. It gives you visibility into where your money is going, how well your commitments are being used, and whether anything unusual is happening with your spend.

[Open Intelligence](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-explorer)

---

## What Intelligence provides

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **[Cost Explorer](./cost-explorer.md)** | Slice and dice your AWS costs by service, account, region, or tag |
| **[Commitment Utilisation](./commitment-utilisation.md)** | Track how effectively your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are being used |
| **[Cost Anomaly Detection](./cost-anomaly-detection.md)** | Detect unexpected spending spikes and get alerted before they become problems |

---

## Data sources

Intelligence pulls data from your AWS accounts via:

- **AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** — Detailed line-item billing data
- **AWS Cost Explorer API** — Aggregated cost and usage data

Data is fetched automatically from all healthy [Connections](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts). No additional setup is needed beyond connecting your AWS accounts.

---

## Data freshness and caching

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Refresh interval** | Cost data is refreshed every 30 minutes |
| **Cache TTL** | 30 minutes — repeated queries within this window use cached data |
| **Daily API call cap** | Applies per Connection to stay within AWS Cost Explorer API limits |
| **Monthly API call cap** | Aggregate limit across all Connections |

> **Note**
AWS Cost and Usage Reports can take up to 24 hours to reflect the most recent charges. Data for the current day may be incomplete until the following day.


---

## IAM permissions

Intelligence requires the following IAM permissions on each Connection's role:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
    "ce:GetCostForecast",
    "ce:GetReservationUtilization",
    "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization",
    "ce:GetAnomalies",
    "ce:GetAnomalyMonitors",
    "ce:GetAnomalySubscriptions"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

For the full IAM policy, see [IAM Role Permissions](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions).

---

## How Intelligence relates to other pillars

- **Automate** — Intelligence shows the cost impact of your automation. The [Projected vs Actual Savings](/docs/dashboard/projected-vs-actual-savings) chart ties Intelligence data to Automate results.
- **Guard** — Intelligence data feeds into Guard's [Budgets](/docs/category/guard) for threshold tracking and into [Cost Attribution](/docs/category/guard) for team-level cost breakdowns.

# Cost Explorer

The Cost Explorer gives you a detailed, interactive view of your AWS spending. Group costs by service, account, region, or tag to understand exactly where your money is going.

[Open Cost Explorer](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-explorer)


---

## Grouping dimensions

Break down your costs using any of these dimensions:

| Dimension | What it shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Service** | Spend per AWS service (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, etc.) |
| **Account** | Spend per AWS account (useful for multi-account organisations) |
| **Region** | Spend per AWS region |
| **Tag** | Spend per tag key:value pair (e.g. `Environment:dev` vs `Environment:prod`) |

You can combine dimensions to create more specific views — for example, grouping by **Service** then **Account** to see which accounts are driving EC2 costs.

---

## Date range and granularity

| Control | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Date range** | Last 7 days, last 30 days, this month, last month, last 3 months, last 6 months, last 12 months, custom range |
| **Granularity** | Daily or Monthly |

> **Tip**
Use **daily** granularity for short ranges (7–30 days) to spot day-to-day fluctuations. Switch to **monthly** for longer ranges to see trends without noise.


---

## Filters

Narrow your view with filters:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Connection** | Include only specific AWS accounts |
| **Service** | Include only specific AWS services |
| **Region** | Include only specific AWS regions |
| **Tag** | Include only resources with specific tags |

Filters can be combined. For example, filter by `Connection: Production` and `Service: EC2` to see only EC2 spend in your production account.

---

## Reading the chart

The Cost Explorer displays costs as a stacked bar chart (grouped view) or a line chart (single dimension). Hover over any data point to see the exact amount.

Below the chart, a summary table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Group** | The dimension value (e.g. service name, account ID) |
| **Total** | Total spend for the selected period |
| **Average** | Average daily or monthly spend |
| **Trend** | Percentage change compared to the previous period |

---

## Export and download

Click **Export** to download the current view as a CSV file. The export includes all data points visible in the chart and table, respecting your current filters and grouping.

---

## Common use cases

| Use case | How to set it up |
|----------|------------------|
| **Which service costs the most?** | Group by Service, last 30 days, monthly granularity |
| **Are dev costs growing?** | Filter by tag `Environment:dev`, last 3 months, monthly granularity |
| **Which region is most expensive?** | Group by Region, this month |
| **Cost per team** | Group by tag `Team`, last month (requires consistent team tagging) |
| **Spot a cost spike** | No grouping, last 7 days, daily granularity — look for outlier bars |

---

## Tips for effective cost analysis

- **Tag consistently** — Cost Explorer is most powerful when resources are tagged with meaningful dimensions like `Environment`, `Team`, and `Project`
- **Compare periods** — Use the trend column to spot month-over-month changes
- **Drill down** — Start broad (group by Service), then narrow (filter to the top service, group by Account) to find the root cause of unexpected spend
- **Set up alerts** — If you spot a pattern worth monitoring, configure [Cost Anomaly Detection](./cost-anomaly-detection.md) to alert you automatically


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/intelligence/commitment-utilisation

# Commitment Utilisation

The Commitment Utilisation view tracks how effectively your Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans are being used. Under-utilised commitments represent money already spent that is not delivering value — this page helps you identify and address that waste.

[View Commitment Utilisation](https://dashboard.frugally.app/commitment-utilisation)

---

## What is tracked

| Commitment type | What frugally.app monitors |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Reserved Instances** | EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, and OpenSearch RIs |
| **Savings Plans** | Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, SageMaker Savings Plans |

---

## Utilisation vs coverage

These are two distinct metrics:

| Metric | Definition | Goal |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Utilisation** | What percentage of your purchased commitment hours are actually being used | As close to 100% as possible |
| **Coverage** | What percentage of your eligible on-demand usage is covered by commitments | Depends on your commitment strategy |

### Example

You purchased a 1-year RI for 10 EC2 `m5.large` instances. If only 7 are running at any given time:

- **Utilisation** = 70% — you are using 7 of 10 purchased instances
- 3 instance-hours per hour are wasted (paid for but unused)

If you also have 5 additional `m5.large` instances running on-demand:

- **Coverage** = 7 / 12 = 58% — 7 of your 12 total instances are covered by the RI

---

## The utilisation dashboard


The dashboard shows:

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overall utilisation** | Aggregate utilisation percentage across all commitments |
| **By commitment type** | Breakdown by RIs and Savings Plans |
| **By service** | Utilisation per AWS service |
| **Trend** | Utilisation over time (daily or monthly) |
| **Expiring commitments** | Commitments expiring in the next 30, 60, and 90 days |

---

## Interpreting your utilisation

| Utilisation | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **95–100%** | Excellent — commitments are fully used | Monitor for upcoming expirations |
| **80–94%** | Good — minor waste, may be acceptable | Check if under-used commitments can be exchanged or modified |
| **60–79%** | Needs attention — significant unused capacity | Review which instances are missing or stopped; consider exchanging unused RIs |
| **Below 60%** | Poor — substantial waste | Investigate root cause; consider letting commitments expire rather than renewing |

---

## Recommendations for improving utilisation

1. **Right-size commitments** — Match RI quantities to actual sustained usage, not peak usage
2. **Use flexible RIs** — Regional RIs and Convertible RIs offer more flexibility to adapt to changes
3. **Coordinate with Automate** — If you are stopping resources via [Schedules](/docs/automate/schedules/overview), ensure those resources are not covered by RIs (stopping an RI-covered instance wastes the RI hours)
4. **Monitor expirations** — Use the expiring commitments widget to plan renewals or adjustments
5. **Exchange unused RIs** — Where AWS allows, exchange under-utilised Convertible RIs for types that match your current workloads

> **Tip**
If you are using frugally.app Automate to stop non-production resources, buy RIs only for resources that run 24/7 (typically production). Non-production resources that are stopped overnight and on weekends will have low RI utilisation by design.


---

## Data freshness

Commitment utilisation data is sourced from the AWS Cost Explorer API and follows the same caching and refresh schedule described in the [Intelligence Overview](./overview.md). Data may be up to 24 hours behind for the current day.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/intelligence/cost-anomaly-detection

# Cost Anomaly Detection

Cost anomaly detection monitors your AWS spending and alerts you when costs deviate significantly from normal patterns. It helps you catch billing surprises before they become expensive problems.

---

## How anomaly detection works

frugally.app establishes a **rolling baseline** of your spending patterns using the last 7 days of cost data. When actual spending exceeds the baseline by more than the configured threshold, an anomaly is flagged.

```
Baseline (7-day rolling average) + Threshold → Anomaly triggered
```

The baseline updates daily, so it adapts to gradual changes in your spending. Only sudden, unexpected deviations are flagged.

---

## Threshold configuration

You can configure how sensitive anomaly detection should be:

| Threshold type | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Percentage** | Triggers when spend exceeds the baseline by a percentage | 20% above baseline |
| **Absolute** | Triggers when spend exceeds the baseline by a fixed dollar amount | $50 above baseline |
| **Standard deviations** | Triggers based on statistical deviation from the baseline | 2 standard deviations |

> **Tip**
Start with a **percentage threshold of 20%** — this catches meaningful spikes without generating too much noise. Tighten it once you understand your normal spending variance.


Configure thresholds at **Settings** > **Monitoring** > **Anomaly Detection**.

---

## Alert delivery

When an anomaly is detected, alerts can be delivered through:

| Channel | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| **In-app** | Always enabled — anomalies appear in the Dashboard and Intelligence views |
| **Slack** | Posted to configured channels — set up in [Slack integration](/docs/getting-started/connecting-slack) settings |
| **Email** | Sent to team members based on notification preferences |

Each alert includes:

- **Service and account** — Which AWS service and account the anomaly relates to
- **Expected vs actual** — The baseline amount and the actual spend
- **Deviation** — How much the actual exceeds the expected (percentage and absolute)
- **Time period** — When the anomaly was detected


---

## Investigating anomalies

When you receive an anomaly alert:

1. **Click the alert** to open the anomaly detail view
2. **Review the breakdown** — See which service, account, and region contributed to the spike
3. **Check recent changes** — Look at recent [Executions](/docs/automate/executions/overview), deployments, or infrastructure changes that may explain the increase
4. **Use Cost Explorer** — Open the [Cost Explorer](./cost-explorer.md) filtered to the affected service and time period for a deeper analysis

---

## Managing anomalies

| Action | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | You have seen the anomaly and are investigating — removes it from the active alerts list |
| **Dismiss** | The anomaly is expected (e.g. a planned migration or load test) — marks it as resolved with a reason |
| **Create a budget** | The anomaly reveals a need for spending controls — links to Guard [Budget](/docs/category/guard) creation |

---

## Suppression rules

If certain spending patterns are expected but would normally trigger anomalies, you can create suppression rules:

| Rule type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Service** | Suppress anomalies for a specific AWS service |
| **Account** | Suppress anomalies for a specific AWS account |
| **Time window** | Suppress anomalies during a specific time period (e.g. during a planned migration) |
| **Minimum threshold** | Only alert on anomalies above a minimum dollar amount |

Suppression rules help reduce noise without disabling detection entirely.

---

## Best practices

- **Set meaningful thresholds** — Too sensitive means alert fatigue; too loose means missed anomalies
- **Act on alerts promptly** — Cost anomalies can compound quickly
- **Use dismissal reasons** — When dismissing an anomaly, add a reason so your team understands why it was expected
- **Review suppression rules periodically** — Temporary suppressions should be removed after the planned event ends
- **Combine with budgets** — Anomaly detection catches spikes; [Budgets](/docs/category/guard) catch sustained overspend

## Key concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Project** | A governance container for an infrastructure change proposal, with an intent (create, modify, optimise, or destroy), affected resources, and an approval workflow |
| **Budget** | A spending limit tracked against actual AWS costs, with alerts at configurable thresholds |
| **Violation** | A detected breach of a budget, policy, or compliance rule |
| **Scan** | A periodic compliance check that evaluates your environment against configured rules |
| **Finding** | A specific issue discovered during a scan |
| **Posture** | A composite score representing overall cost health |

For a full list of terms, see the [Glossary](/docs/glossary).

---

## Getting started with Guard

> **Pro feature**
Guard features are available on the Pro and Enterprise plans. See [Billing](/docs/category/billing) for plan details.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/guard/projects/overview

# Projects Overview

A **Guard Project** is a governance container for proposing, reviewing, and approving infrastructure changes. Instead of making changes ad-hoc, Projects give your team a structured process with accountability and an audit trail.

[View Projects](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-guard/projects)

---

## What a Project contains

Every Project includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive title for the change (e.g. "Migrate staging to Graviton instances") |
| **Intent** | The type of change: **Create**, **Modify**, **Optimise**, or **Destroy** |
| **Description** | A detailed explanation of what is being proposed and why |
| **Affected resources** | The AWS resources that will be impacted |
| **Estimated cost impact** | The expected change in costs (increase, decrease, or neutral) |
| **Approval rules** | Who needs to approve before the change can proceed |
| **Version history** | A record of all changes to the proposal |

---

## Project intents

| Intent | Use case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Create** | Launching new infrastructure | Deploying a new ECS cluster for a microservice |
| **Modify** | Changing existing infrastructure | Upgrading RDS instance types |
| **Optimise** | Reducing costs or improving efficiency | Rightsizing over-provisioned EC2 instances |
| **Destroy** | Decommissioning infrastructure | Removing unused NAT Gateways |

---

## How Projects group infrastructure

Projects are scoped to your [Connections](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts) and can reference resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions. This lets you propose changes that span your entire environment in a single, reviewable unit.

Resources in a Project can be:
- **Existing resources** — Selected from your connected AWS accounts
- **Planned resources** — Described manually for new infrastructure that does not yet exist

---

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to **Guard** > **Projects** > **Create Project**
2. Fill in the Project details (name, intent, description)
3. Add affected resources
4. Configure [approval rules](./approval-rules.md)
5. Submit for review


The Project is created in **Draft** state. See [Workflow](./workflow.md) for the full lifecycle.

---

## In this section

- **[Approval Rules](./approval-rules.md)** — Configure who can approve changes and under what conditions
- **[Workflow](./workflow.md)** — The full lifecycle from Draft to Executed


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules

# Approval Rules

Approval rules define who must approve a Guard Project before it can proceed. They ensure that infrastructure changes are reviewed by the right people, with appropriate oversight based on the scope and risk of the change.

---

## How approval rules work

Each Project can have one or more approval rules attached. An approval rule specifies:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Approver** | Who can approve — a specific user, a role (e.g. all Admins), or a Group |
| **Minimum approvals** | How many approvals are required (e.g. at least 2 Admins) |
| **Conditions** | Optional conditions that trigger this rule (e.g. cost impact above $500) |

When a Project is submitted for review, all matching approval rules must be satisfied before the Project can move to the Approved state.

---

## Rule types

### User-based rules

Require approval from specific named users.

| Example | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| "VP of Engineering must approve" | Approver: specific user, min approvals: 1 |
| "Both team leads must approve" | Approver: specific users (list), min approvals: 2 |

### Role-based rules

Require approval from any user with a specific role.

| Example | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| "Any Admin can approve" | Approver: Admin role, min approvals: 1 |
| "Two Admins must approve" | Approver: Admin role, min approvals: 2 |

### Group-based rules

Require approval from members of a [Group](/docs/roles-and-access/groups).

| Example | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| "Someone from the Platform team must approve" | Approver: Platform team group, min approvals: 1 |
| "Two FinOps team members must approve" | Approver: FinOps team group, min approvals: 2 |

---

## Conditional rules

Rules can include conditions that determine when they apply:

| Condition | Triggers when |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Cost impact threshold** | Estimated cost impact exceeds a configured amount (e.g. > $500/month) |
| **Intent type** | Project intent matches a specific type (e.g. Destroy) |
| **Resource count** | Number of affected resources exceeds a threshold |
| **Service type** | Affected resources include specific AWS services |

### Example: escalating approvals

| Condition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Cost impact < $500/month | 1 approval from any Admin |
| Cost impact $500–$5,000/month | 2 approvals from Admin role |
| Cost impact > $5,000/month | 1 approval from FinOps team + 1 approval from VP Engineering |
| Intent = Destroy | 2 approvals from Admin role regardless of cost |

---

## Multi-level approval chains

For changes that require sign-off at multiple levels, configure multiple rules on the same Project. All rules must be satisfied independently:

```
Rule 1: Technical review — 1 approval from Engineering team
Rule 2: Cost review    — 1 approval from FinOps team
Rule 3: Final sign-off — 1 approval from Admin role
```

All three must be satisfied before the Project is approved. Approvals can happen in any order.

---

## Managing approval rules

Approval rules can be configured:

- **Per Project** — Set rules when creating or editing a Project
- **As templates** — Create reusable rule templates at **Guard** > **Settings** > **Approval Templates** and apply them to new Projects

> **Tip**
Create approval templates for common scenarios (e.g. "standard change", "high-cost change", "decommission") to ensure consistent governance without manual configuration each time.


---

## Who can approve

Approvers must have the appropriate [role and permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/scopes). A user cannot approve their own Project submission — at least one other person must review it.

> **Note**
Self-approval is blocked by design to maintain separation of duties. The Project creator can be an approver on other Projects.

# Project Workflow

Every Guard Project follows a versioned workflow from initial proposal through approval to execution. The workflow ensures changes are reviewed, approved by the right people, and tracked with a full audit trail.

---

## Workflow stages

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved / Rejected → Executed
```

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Draft** | The Project is being prepared. It can be edited freely. |
| **Submitted** | The Project has been submitted for review. Approval rules are evaluated. |
| **Approved** | All approval rules are satisfied. The change can proceed. |
| **Rejected** | One or more approvers have rejected the Project. It can be revised and resubmitted. |
| **Executed** | The approved change has been carried out. The Project is closed. |


---

## What triggers each transition

### Draft → Submitted

The Project creator clicks **Submit for Review**. At this point:

- The Project is locked for editing (a new version must be created to make changes)
- Notifications are sent to all potential approvers
- The approval clock starts

### Submitted → Approved

All [approval rules](./approval-rules.md) are satisfied. This happens when:

- The required number of approvers have approved
- All conditional rules that apply have been met

### Submitted → Rejected

Any approver clicks **Reject** and provides a reason. The Project returns to a state where the creator can:

- **Revise and resubmit** — Create a new version with changes addressing the feedback
- **Withdraw** — Cancel the Project entirely

### Approved → Executed

The Project creator or an Admin marks the change as executed. This can happen when:

- The infrastructure change has been applied (manually or via Automate)
- The Project is linked to an [Execution](/docs/automate/executions/overview) that has completed

---

## Versioning

Every significant change to a Project creates a new version. The version history records:

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Version number** | Sequential (v1, v2, v3, etc.) |
| **Changed by** | The user who made the change |
| **Changed at** | Timestamp |
| **Changes** | What was modified (description, resources, cost estimate, etc.) |
| **Reason** | Why the change was made (especially after rejection) |

Previous versions are read-only and preserved for audit purposes.

> **Tip**
When a Project is rejected, create a new version that addresses the feedback rather than starting from scratch. The version history shows reviewers what changed between submissions.


---

## Notifications at each stage

| Transition | Who is notified |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Draft → Submitted** | All potential approvers (based on approval rules) |
| **Approval received** | Project creator, other pending approvers |
| **Submitted → Approved** | Project creator, all approvers |
| **Submitted → Rejected** | Project creator |
| **Approved → Executed** | All approvers, project creator |

Notifications are delivered via:
- **In-app** — Always enabled
- **Slack** — If a channel is configured for Guard notifications
- **Email** — Based on user notification preferences

---

## Audit trail

Every action on a Project is logged in its audit trail:

- Who created, edited, submitted, approved, rejected, or executed the Project
- Timestamps for every action
- Comments and reasons provided by approvers
- Version diffs showing what changed between submissions

The audit trail is immutable and available to all team members with access to the Project.

---

## Withdrawing a Project

A Project creator can withdraw a submitted Project at any time before it is approved or rejected. Withdrawing moves the Project back to Draft state and clears any partial approvals.

---

## Linking Projects to Executions

When a Project proposes changes that can be carried out by [Automate](/docs/automate/overview), you can link the Project to a Target. Once approved, the linked Target's resources can be acted on through a manual [Execution](/docs/automate/executions/manual-executions) or a [Schedule](/docs/automate/schedules/overview), and the Project is automatically marked as Executed when the Execution completes.

# Budgets

Budgets let you set spending limits on your AWS costs and receive alerts when consumption approaches or exceeds those limits. They are a core Guard tool for preventing cost overruns.

[View Budgets](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-guard/budgets)

---

## Creating a budget

Navigate to **Guard** > **Budgets** > **Create Budget** and fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive label (e.g. "Dev team monthly budget") |
| **Amount** | The spending limit in your account currency |
| **Period** | Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual |
| **Scope** | What the budget covers — all spend, a specific Connection, service, tag, or combination |
| **Alert thresholds** | Percentages at which to send alerts |


---

## Budget types

| Period | How it works |
|--------|-------------|
| **Monthly** | Resets on the 1st of each month. Tracks spend for the current calendar month. |
| **Quarterly** | Resets every 3 months (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). Tracks spend for the current quarter. |
| **Annual** | Resets on January 1st. Tracks spend for the current calendar year. |

---

## Threshold alerts

Configure one or more alert thresholds as percentages of the budget amount. Common configurations:

| Threshold | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **50%** | Early warning — you are halfway through the budget |
| **80%** | Action needed — approaching the limit |
| **100%** | Budget breached — a [violation](./violations-and-remediation.md) is created |
| **120%** | Significant overspend — escalation may be needed |

Alerts are sent once per threshold per budget period. If spend drops below a threshold and then rises above it again in the same period, the alert is not re-sent.

---

## Budget vs actual spend

The budget detail page shows a chart comparing your budget amount against actual spend over the period:


| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Budget line** | The configured spending limit |
| **Actual bars** | Daily or monthly spend |
| **Forecast line** | Projected spend for the remainder of the period based on current trajectory |
| **Threshold markers** | Horizontal lines at each configured threshold |

> **Tip**
If the forecast line exceeds your budget before the period ends, consider taking action now — review the [Cost Explorer](/docs/intelligence/cost-explorer) to identify what is driving the spend.


---

## Budget scoping

Budgets can be scoped to control exactly what spend they track:

| Scope | Tracks spend for |
|-------|-----------------|
| **All** | Total spend across all Connections |
| **Connection** | A specific AWS account |
| **Service** | A specific AWS service (e.g. EC2 only) |
| **Tag** | Resources with specific tags (e.g. `Team:backend`) |
| **Combination** | Multiple filters combined (e.g. EC2 in production account) |

---

## What happens when a budget is breached

When actual spend exceeds 100% of the budget:

1. An alert is sent to configured channels (in-app, Slack, email)
2. A [Violation](./violations-and-remediation.md) is created with severity based on the overspend amount
3. The budget is flagged on the Dashboard and Guard overview

Budgets are **advisory by default** — they do not automatically block spending. For enforced spending controls, combine budgets with Guard [Projects](./projects/overview.md) and approval workflows.

---

## Managing budgets

From the Budgets list page you can:

- **Edit** — Change the amount, period, scope, or thresholds
- **Pause** — Temporarily stop tracking and alerts without deleting the budget
- **Delete** — Remove the budget entirely (historical data is retained)
- **Duplicate** — Create a new budget with the same configuration


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/guard/cost-attribution

# Cost Attribution

Cost attribution assigns your AWS spending to the teams, projects, or departments responsible for it. This creates accountability and helps teams understand the cost impact of their infrastructure decisions.

---

## Why cost attribution matters

Without attribution, AWS costs are a single line item that no one owns. With attribution:

- **Teams see their costs** — Engineers understand the financial impact of their infrastructure
- **Finance gets clarity** — Costs can be allocated to cost centres or business units
- **Optimisation is targeted** — You know which teams have the most room to improve
- **Budgets are meaningful** — Team-level [Budgets](./budgets.md) only work if costs are attributed correctly

---

## Attribution adapters

frugally.app supports six cost attribution adapters. Each adapter uses a different method to map AWS costs to teams:

| Adapter | How it attributes costs |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Tag-based** | Uses a specific AWS tag key (e.g. `Team`, `CostCentre`, `Department`) to assign costs to the tag's value |
| **Account-based** | Maps entire AWS accounts to teams (e.g. account 123456789012 = Backend team) |
| **Service-based** | Maps AWS services to teams (e.g. all RDS costs = Database team) |
| **Connection-based** | Maps frugally.app Connections to teams |
| **Group-based** | Maps costs to frugally.app [Groups](/docs/roles-and-access/groups) based on Group scope assignments |
| **Custom rules** | Flexible rules combining multiple dimensions (tags, accounts, services, regions) |

---

## Configuring attribution

Navigate to **Guard** > **Cost Attribution** > **Configure**.

### Step 1 — Choose adapters

Select one or more adapters. You can use multiple adapters — they are evaluated in priority order, and the first match wins.

### Step 2 — Configure each adapter

| Adapter | Configuration needed |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Tag-based** | Select the tag key to use (e.g. `Team`) |
| **Account-based** | Map each AWS account to a team name |
| **Service-based** | Map each AWS service to a team name |
| **Connection-based** | Map each Connection to a team name |
| **Group-based** | Ensure Groups have [Scopes](/docs/roles-and-access/scopes) assigned |
| **Custom rules** | Define rules with conditions and target teams |

### Step 3 — Handle unattributed costs

Costs that do not match any adapter rule are marked as **Unattributed**. You can:

- Leave them unattributed (they appear in a separate bucket)
- Assign a default team for unattributed costs
- Distribute them proportionally across all teams

---

## Viewing attributed costs

Once configured, attributed costs appear in:

| Location | View |
|----------|------|
| **Guard > Cost Attribution** | Full breakdown by team with trends |
| **Cost Explorer** | Group by "Team" dimension (powered by attribution rules) |
| **Executive Dashboard** | Team-level cost summary |
| **Budget tracking** | Team-scoped budgets use attributed costs |


---

## Attribution accuracy

The accuracy of attribution depends on your data quality:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Tag coverage** | Resources without the attribution tag key will be unattributed |
| **Tag consistency** | Inconsistent values (e.g. "Backend" vs "backend") create duplicate teams |
| **Shared resources** | Resources used by multiple teams (e.g. shared RDS) may need custom rules to split costs |
| **Adapter priority** | When multiple adapters match, only the highest-priority adapter's result is used |

> **Tip**
Run a tag coverage report from **Guard** > **Cost Attribution** > **Coverage** to see what percentage of your spend is attributed vs unattributed. Aim for 90%+ attribution coverage.


---

## Best practices

1. **Start with tags** — Tag-based attribution is the most flexible and widely applicable
2. **Standardise tag values** — Use a controlled list of team names to avoid duplicates
3. **Use account-based as a fallback** — If tagging is inconsistent, account-based attribution provides a coarse but reliable mapping
4. **Review monthly** — Check the unattributed bucket regularly and update rules as your infrastructure evolves
5. **Combine with Budgets** — Once costs are attributed, set [Budgets](./budgets.md) per team to create accountability

# Scans and Findings

Guard Scans are periodic compliance checks that evaluate your AWS environment against configured rules. Each Scan produces **Findings** — specific issues that may require attention.

---

## What Scans check

Scans evaluate your environment for:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Cost optimisation** | Unused resources, over-provisioned instances, idle load balancers |
| **Tagging compliance** | Resources missing required tags, inconsistent tag values |
| **Security posture** | Unencrypted volumes, public S3 buckets, overly permissive security groups |
| **Configuration standards** | Resources not matching your team's defined standards |

---

## Scan frequency and triggers

| Trigger | When it runs |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scheduled** | Runs automatically on a configurable schedule (daily, weekly, or custom) |
| **Manual** | Triggered on demand from the Guard Scans page |
| **On change** | Triggered when frugally.app detects a change in your AWS environment (new resources, tag changes, etc.) |

Configure scan frequency at **Guard** > **Scans** > **Settings**.

---

## Types of findings

Each finding represents a specific issue discovered during a scan.

| Finding type | Severity | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Unused resource** | Medium–High | A resource is running but has no recent activity (e.g. EC2 instance with 0% CPU for 7+ days) |
| **Over-provisioned** | Medium | A resource is significantly larger than its usage requires |
| **Missing required tag** | Low–Medium | A resource does not have one or more required tag keys |
| **Inconsistent tags** | Low | Tag values do not match the expected controlled vocabulary |
| **Unencrypted storage** | High | An EBS volume or S3 bucket does not have encryption enabled |
| **Idle load balancer** | Medium | An ALB/NLB has no healthy targets registered |

---

## Viewing scan results

Navigate to **Guard** > **Scans** to see scan history and results.


Each scan result shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scan date** | When the scan ran |
| **Findings** | Total count of findings by severity |
| **New** | Findings that appeared for the first time in this scan |
| **Resolved** | Findings from previous scans that are no longer detected |
| **Status** | Completed, Running, or Failed |

---

## Working with findings

### Viewing a finding

Click any finding to see:

- **Resource details** — The affected resource with its ID, type, region, and tags
- **Explanation** — Why this was flagged and what the expected state should be
- **Recommended action** — Steps to resolve the finding
- **History** — How long this finding has been present across scans

### Acting on findings

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create Violation** | Escalates the finding to a [Violation](./violations-and-remediation.md) for formal tracking and remediation |
| **Create Project** | Creates a Guard [Project](./projects/overview.md) to propose a fix through the approval workflow |
| **Dismiss** | Marks the finding as accepted risk with a reason (e.g. "This resource is needed for disaster recovery") |
| **Suppress** | Prevents this specific finding from appearing in future scans |

---

## Exporting results

Click **Export** on any scan result to download findings as a CSV file. The export includes all finding details, severities, and affected resources.

---

## Scan configuration

Customise what scans check for at **Guard** > **Scans** > **Rules**:

- **Enable/disable rule categories** — Turn entire categories on or off
- **Adjust thresholds** — Change what counts as "over-provisioned" or "idle"
- **Required tags** — Define which tag keys are mandatory for compliance
- **Exclusions** — Exclude specific resources, accounts, or regions from scans

> **Tip**
Start with the default ruleset and tune thresholds after reviewing your first few scan results. This prevents alert fatigue while still catching the most impactful issues.

# Violations and Remediation

A **violation** is a detected breach of a budget, policy, or compliance rule. Violations surface issues that need attention and provide a structured path to resolution.

---

## What constitutes a violation

| Source | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| **Budget breach** | Actual spend exceeds 100% of a [Budget](./budgets.md) |
| **Policy non-compliance** | A resource or configuration does not meet a defined policy (e.g. untagged resources, over-provisioned instances) |
| **Scan finding** | A [Scan](./scans-and-findings.md) discovers a compliance issue |
| **Anomaly** | A [cost anomaly](/docs/intelligence/cost-anomaly-detection) exceeds the configured threshold |

---

## Violation severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Critical** | Immediate action required — significant financial or compliance impact | Budget exceeded by 50%+, production resource without required tags |
| **High** | Urgent — should be addressed within 24 hours | Budget exceeded by 20%+, unencrypted storage volume |
| **Medium** | Important — should be addressed within the current sprint | Over-provisioned instance, unused Elastic IP |
| **Low** | Informational — address when convenient | Minor tagging inconsistency, non-critical resource without cost tags |

Severity is assigned automatically based on the violation type and magnitude. You can override the severity manually if needed.

---

## Viewing violations

Navigate to **Guard** > **Violations** to see all active violations.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Severity** | Colour-coded severity indicator |
| **Type** | Budget, Policy, Scan, or Anomaly |
| **Description** | What the violation is about |
| **Resource** | The affected resource(s) or budget |
| **Detected** | When the violation was first detected |
| **Status** | Open, Acknowledged, Remediated, or Dismissed |


---

## Remediation options

### Manual remediation

Review the violation, investigate the root cause, and take action yourself:

1. Click the violation to view details
2. Review the recommended remediation steps
3. Take action in AWS or frugally.app
4. Mark the violation as **Remediated** with a note explaining what you did

### Automated remediation

Some violation types support automated remediation:

| Violation type | Automated action |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Over-provisioned instance** | Propose a rightsizing change via a Guard [Project](./projects/overview.md) |
| **Unused resource** | Propose a decommission action via a Guard Project |
| **Missing tags** | Apply default tags via an automated tagging rule |
| **Budget breach** | Trigger a notification escalation to stakeholders |

Automated remediation creates a **draft** action that requires approval before execution — it never makes changes to your AWS environment without human review.

> **Note**
Automated remediation is available on the Enterprise plan. See [Billing](/docs/category/billing) for plan details.


---

## Violation lifecycle

```
Open → Acknowledged → Remediated / Dismissed
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Open** | Newly detected, not yet reviewed |
| **Acknowledged** | Someone is investigating or working on it |
| **Remediated** | The underlying issue has been fixed |
| **Dismissed** | The violation has been closed without action (with a reason) |

---

## Tracking resolution

The violation detail page tracks:

- **Timeline** — When the violation was detected, acknowledged, and resolved
- **Assigned to** — The team member responsible for remediation
- **Comments** — Discussion and notes from the team
- **Related items** — Linked Budgets, Scans, Projects, or Executions

---

## Best practices

- **Triage regularly** — Review open violations daily or as part of your team standup
- **Assign ownership** — Every violation should have a named owner
- **Use severity to prioritise** — Focus on Critical and High first
- **Dismiss with reasons** — If a violation is not actionable, dismiss it with a clear explanation so your team understands why
- **Track trends** — A rising violation count may indicate a systemic issue worth addressing at the process level

# Cost Posture

Cost Posture is a snapshot score that represents your team's overall cost health. It combines multiple signals — waste, coverage, optimisation opportunities, and compliance — into a single metric you can track over time.

---

## What Cost Posture measures

The posture score is a value from 0 to 100, calculated from four dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Waste** | 30% | Unused resources, idle infrastructure, and resources running during non-business hours without schedules |
| **Coverage** | 25% | Percentage of eligible resources covered by [Targets](/docs/automate/targets/overview) and [Schedules](/docs/automate/schedules/overview) |
| **Optimisation** | 25% | How many [Recommendations](./recommendations.md) have been accepted vs ignored |
| **Compliance** | 20% | Ratio of clean [Scan](./scans-and-findings.md) findings to total findings; open [Violations](./violations-and-remediation.md) count |

---

## Score interpretation

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **80–100** | Excellent | Low waste, high coverage, recommendations addressed, few open violations |
| **60–79** | Good | Mostly healthy, but some areas need attention |
| **40–59** | Needs improvement | Significant waste or gaps in coverage and compliance |
| **0–39** | Poor | Substantial optimisation opportunity — review all dimensions |

---

## How the score is calculated

### Waste (30%)

Points are deducted for:
- Resources running outside business hours without an active Schedule
- Resources with zero or near-zero utilisation over the past 7 days
- Unused Elastic IPs, idle load balancers, and unattached EBS volumes

### Coverage (25%)

Points are awarded for:
- Percentage of discovered resources included in at least one Target
- Percentage of non-production resources covered by active Schedules
- Percentage of spend attributed to teams via [Cost Attribution](./cost-attribution.md)

### Optimisation (25%)

Points are awarded for:
- Recommendations accepted and implemented
- Points are deducted for recommendations that have been open for more than 30 days without action

### Compliance (20%)

Points are awarded for:
- Low ratio of open Scan findings to total resources
- No open Critical or High severity Violations
- Points are deducted for each open Violation based on severity

---

## Viewing your Cost Posture

Navigate to **Guard** > **Cost Posture** to see your current score and historical trend.


The dashboard shows:

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overall score** | Your current posture score with label (Excellent, Good, etc.) |
| **Dimension breakdown** | Per-dimension scores showing which areas need attention |
| **Trend chart** | Score over time (daily, weekly, or monthly) |
| **Improvement opportunities** | Top actions that would improve your score the most |

---

## Historical trends

The trend chart tracks your posture score over time. Use it to:

- **Measure progress** — See the impact of your optimisation efforts
- **Spot regressions** — Catch score drops that indicate new waste or compliance issues
- **Report to stakeholders** — Share posture trends with leadership via the [Executive Dashboard](./executive-dashboard.md)

---

## Improving your score

The Cost Posture page lists the top improvement opportunities ranked by impact:

| Opportunity | Dimension | Example action |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Schedule unmanaged resources** | Waste + Coverage | Run the [Onboarding Wizard](/docs/automate/onboarding-wizard) to create Targets and Schedules |
| **Address open Recommendations** | Optimisation | Review and accept [Recommendations](./recommendations.md) |
| **Resolve open Violations** | Compliance | Remediate [Violations](./violations-and-remediation.md) |
| **Improve tag coverage** | Coverage | Tag resources and configure [Cost Attribution](./cost-attribution.md) |
| **Clean up unused resources** | Waste | Delete or decommission resources flagged in [Scans](./scans-and-findings.md) |

> **Tip**
Focus on the highest-impact improvements first. Addressing waste and coverage typically produces the largest score gains.

# Maturity Assessment

The FinOps Maturity Assessment is a self-assessment tool that measures how mature your team's FinOps practices are across key dimensions. It produces a score, identifies gaps, and provides a guided improvement path.

---

## What the assessment measures

The assessment evaluates four dimensions of FinOps maturity:

| Dimension | What it covers |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Visibility** | Can your team see where money is being spent? Do you have cost reporting, attribution, and dashboards in place? |
| **Optimisation** | Are you actively reducing waste? Do you use scheduling, rightsizing, and commitment strategies? |
| **Governance** | Do you have controls in place? Are budgets set, approvals required, and policies enforced? |
| **Culture** | Does your team think about cost as part of engineering decisions? Is FinOps embedded in your workflow? |

---

## Maturity levels

Each dimension is scored on a three-level maturity scale:

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Crawl | Basic awareness. Some tools in place, but practices are ad-hoc and reactive. |
| **2** | Walk | Structured practices. Processes are defined, tooling is configured, and the team regularly reviews costs. |
| **3** | Run | Proactive and automated. FinOps is embedded in the development lifecycle, with automation, governance, and continuous improvement. |

---

## How to complete the assessment

1. Navigate to **Guard** > **Maturity Assessment**
2. Answer the questions for each dimension (10–15 questions total)
3. Review your scores and the recommended improvement path
4. Retake the assessment periodically (recommended: quarterly) to track progress

### Question format

Each question describes a practice and asks you to select the level that best describes your team's current state:

| Level | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Crawl** | "We don't do this yet" or "We do this occasionally, ad-hoc" |
| **Walk** | "We have a defined process and do this regularly" |
| **Run** | "This is automated and embedded in our workflow" |

> **Tip**
Be honest in your self-assessment. The goal is to identify improvement areas, not to achieve a high score. An accurate assessment produces more useful recommendations.


---

## Interpreting your results

After completing the assessment, you see:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overall maturity score** | Average across all dimensions (1.0–3.0) |
| **Per-dimension scores** | Individual scores for Visibility, Optimisation, Governance, and Culture |
| **Radar chart** | Visual representation of strengths and gaps |
| **Improvement path** | Specific, actionable recommendations to move from your current level to the next |

---

## The improvement path

For each dimension where you scored below "Run", the assessment provides:

- **Current state** — A summary of where you are
- **Next milestone** — The next maturity level and what it looks like
- **Recommended actions** — Specific steps to take, linked to relevant frugally.app features

### Example improvement recommendations

| Dimension | Current level | Recommended action |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Visibility | Crawl | Configure [Cost Attribution](./cost-attribution.md) and set up the [Cost Explorer](/docs/intelligence/cost-explorer) |
| Optimisation | Walk | Review [Recommendations](./recommendations.md) weekly and enable the [Onboarding Wizard](/docs/automate/onboarding-wizard) for new accounts |
| Governance | Crawl | Set up [Budgets](./budgets.md) for each team and create [approval rules](./projects/approval-rules.md) for high-cost changes |
| Culture | Walk | Share the [Executive Dashboard](./executive-dashboard.md) with leadership and include cost reviews in sprint retrospectives |

---

## Retaking the assessment

Your assessment history is saved, so you can track progress over time. The assessment detail page shows:

- **Score trends** — How each dimension has improved (or regressed) across assessments
- **Comparison** — Side-by-side view of your latest assessment vs the previous one
- **Milestone tracking** — Which recommended actions have been completed

> **Enterprise feature**
The full Maturity Assessment with improvement path and historical tracking is available on the Enterprise plan. Free and Pro plans can access a simplified version with overall scoring.

# Recommendations

Guard generates AI-powered recommendations to help you reduce costs, eliminate waste, and improve your cloud posture. Each recommendation includes an estimated impact so you can prioritise the highest-value actions.

[View Recommendations](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-guard/recommendations)

---

## Recommendation categories

| Category | What it recommends |
|----------|--------------------|
| **Rightsizing** | Downsize over-provisioned instances based on actual utilisation data |
| **Scheduling** | Add Schedules to resources running outside business hours without automation |
| **Commitment** | Purchase or modify Reserved Instances and Savings Plans based on usage patterns |
| **Waste elimination** | Delete or decommission unused resources (idle instances, unattached volumes, unused IPs) |

---

## How recommendations are generated

frugally.app analyses:

- **Resource utilisation** — CPU, memory, and network metrics from CloudWatch
- **Usage patterns** — When resources are active vs idle
- **Cost data** — Current spend and historical trends from [Intelligence](/docs/intelligence/overview)
- **Scan findings** — Issues discovered during [Guard Scans](./scans-and-findings.md)
- **Commitment coverage** — Gaps in RI/Savings Plan coverage from [Commitment Utilisation](/docs/intelligence/commitment-utilisation)

Recommendations are refreshed daily and reflect the most recent data available.

---

## Viewing recommendations

The recommendations page shows a prioritised list:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Category** | Rightsizing, Scheduling, Commitment, or Waste |
| **Description** | What the recommendation suggests |
| **Affected resources** | The resources involved |
| **Estimated monthly savings** | How much you could save by acting on this recommendation |
| **Confidence** | How confident frugally.app is in the recommendation (High, Medium, Low) |
| **Status** | New, Accepted, Dismissed, Snoozed |


---

## Acting on recommendations

### Accept

Accepting a recommendation signals your intent to act on it. Depending on the category:

| Category | What happens on accept |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Rightsizing** | Creates a draft Guard [Project](./projects/overview.md) with the proposed instance type change |
| **Scheduling** | Opens the [Schedule creation](/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule) form pre-filled with the suggested configuration |
| **Commitment** | Provides a summary you can use when purchasing RIs/Savings Plans in the AWS console |
| **Waste** | Creates a draft Guard Project proposing decommission of the resource |

Accepted recommendations are tracked in the [Cost Posture](./cost-posture.md) optimisation dimension.

### Dismiss

Dismissing a recommendation removes it from the active list. You must provide a reason:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Not applicable** | "This resource is intentionally over-provisioned for burst capacity" |
| **Already planned** | "We are migrating this workload next month" |
| **Risk too high** | "Production database — cannot risk downtime for rightsizing" |

Dismissed recommendations do not count against your [Cost Posture](./cost-posture.md) score.

### Snooze

Snoozing hides a recommendation for a configurable period (7, 14, 30, or 90 days). After the snooze expires, the recommendation reappears if it is still relevant.

---

## Estimated impact

Each recommendation shows an estimated monthly savings figure. This is calculated based on:

- **Current cost** — What the resource costs now
- **Proposed cost** — What it would cost after the recommendation is applied
- **Savings** — The difference, projected monthly

> **Note**
Estimated savings are projections based on current pricing and usage. Actual savings may vary based on usage changes, pricing updates, and implementation timing.


---

## Best practices

- **Review weekly** — Check recommendations as part of your regular FinOps routine
- **Prioritise by impact** — Sort by estimated savings and tackle the top items first
- **Validate before acting** — For rightsizing, review CloudWatch metrics to confirm low utilisation is consistent, not a temporary lull
- **Dismiss with reasons** — This helps your team understand why a recommendation was not acted on and prevents it from being re-raised
- **Track accepted recommendations** — Monitor your [Cost Posture](./cost-posture.md) to see the cumulative impact of implemented recommendations

# Resource History and Locks

Resource History tracks changes to your AWS resources over time. Resource Locks let you protect critical resources from automation actions. Together, they give you visibility and control over your cloud environment.

---

## Resource History

### What is tracked

frugally.app records a history entry whenever a resource's state changes, whether caused by frugally.app, manual action in AWS, or an external tool.

| Event type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **State change** | Resource started, stopped, scaled, enabled, or disabled |
| **Tag change** | Tags added, modified, or removed |
| **Configuration change** | Instance type changed, capacity adjusted, etc. |
| **Execution action** | Action taken by a frugally.app [Execution](/docs/automate/executions/overview) |
| **Lock/unlock** | Resource lock applied or removed |

### Viewing resource history

Navigate to **Guard** > **Resource History** and search by resource ID, name, or tags.

Each history entry shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When the change occurred |
| **Event** | What changed (e.g. "Stopped", "Tag added: Environment=dev") |
| **Source** | What caused the change — frugally.app Execution, AWS Console, API, or unknown |
| **User** | The frugally.app user (if the change was made via frugally.app) |
| **Details** | Additional context (Execution ID, before/after values) |


> **Tip**
Resource History is useful for investigating unexpected state changes. If a resource was started outside of frugally.app, the history shows it was an external action, helping you understand why your Schedule's stop action found the resource already running.


---

## Resource Locks

### What resource locks do

A resource lock prevents frugally.app from taking any automation action on a specific resource. Locked resources are skipped during [Executions](/docs/automate/executions/overview) — even if they match a [Target's](/docs/automate/targets/overview) filters.

Use locks to protect critical resources that should never be stopped, scaled, or modified by automation.

### When to use locks

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Production database** | Lock an RDS instance that must never be stopped, even if it matches a non-production Target's tags |
| **Shared infrastructure** | Lock a NAT Gateway used by multiple teams that should not be deleted by a Schedule |
| **Temporary protection** | Lock a resource during a maintenance window to prevent interference |
| **Migration in progress** | Lock resources being migrated to prevent automation during the transition |

### Locking a resource

1. Navigate to **Guard** > **Resource Locks**
2. Click **Create Lock**
3. Search for the resource by ID, name, or tags
4. Add an optional reason (recommended for audit purposes)
5. Save the lock

You can also lock a resource from its detail page in the Resource History view.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Resource** | The AWS resource to lock (by ID) |
| **Reason** | Why the lock was applied (free text) |
| **Locked by** | The user who created the lock |
| **Locked at** | When the lock was created |
| **Expires** | Optional expiry date — the lock is automatically removed after this date |

### Unlocking a resource

Remove a lock from the Resource Locks page or the resource's detail view. Unlocking requires the same permission level as locking.

---

## Lock behaviour during Executions

When an Execution encounters a locked resource:

| Behaviour | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Resource is skipped** | The locked resource is not acted upon |
| **Execution continues** | Other (unlocked) resources in the Target proceed normally |
| **Result noted** | The Execution detail shows the resource as "Skipped — locked" |
| **No failure** | A locked resource does not cause the Execution to fail |

---

## Audit trail

All lock and unlock events are recorded in:

- **Resource History** — As a lock/unlock event on the resource's timeline
- **Guard audit log** — As a governance action with the user, timestamp, and reason

---

## Best practices

- **Always add a reason** — Future team members need to understand why a resource is locked
- **Use expiry dates** — For temporary locks, set an expiry to avoid forgotten locks that prevent future automation
- **Review locks regularly** — Check the Resource Locks page periodically to remove locks that are no longer needed
- **Lock sparingly** — Locks should be the exception. If many resources need locking, reconsider your Target filters to exclude them instead

## Dashboard

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/dashboard/overview

# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is your team's home screen in frugally.app. It provides a real-time summary of your cloud cost savings, active schedules, recent executions, and onboarding progress — all in one place.

[Open the Dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app)

## What you will see

The Dashboard is divided into several widgets, each designed to surface the most important information at a glance.

| Widget | What it shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Savings summary** | Total savings to date, broken down by period (today, this week, this month). |
| **Active schedules** | Number of active Schedules and their next run times. |
| **Recent executions** | The latest Executions with status indicators (succeeded, failed, in progress). |
| **Team activity** | A feed of recent actions taken by team members. |
| **Onboarding checklist** | A progress tracker for new teams to complete initial setup. |
| **Projected vs actual savings** | A chart comparing what your Schedules are expected to save against actual results. |


---

## Navigating the Dashboard

The Dashboard is the default landing page after signing in. You can return to it at any time by clicking **Dashboard** in the left-hand navigation.

Each widget links to its detailed section:

- Click the savings summary to explore cost data in [Intelligence](https://dashboard.frugally.app/cost-explorer)
- Click an Execution to view its full detail on the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions)
- Click an active Schedule to edit it on the [Schedules page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules)

---

## Key sections

- **[Onboarding Checklist](./onboarding-checklist.md)** — Complete your team setup step by step
- **[Projected vs Actual Savings](./projected-vs-actual-savings.md)** — Understand how your savings estimates compare to reality


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/dashboard/onboarding-checklist

# Onboarding Checklist

The onboarding checklist is a Dashboard widget that guides new teams through initial setup. It tracks your progress across the key steps needed to start saving with frugally.app.

## Checklist items

Each item is automatically marked as complete when you finish the corresponding action. No manual ticking required.

| Step | Completion trigger | Link |
|------|--------------------|------|
| **Connect an AWS account** | At least one Connection is in a healthy state | [Connecting Your AWS Accounts](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts) |
| **Create a Target** | At least one Target exists with matched resources | [Creating Targets](/docs/getting-started/creating-targets) |
| **Run an Execution** | At least one Execution has completed (manual or scheduled) | [Running an Execution](/docs/getting-started/running-an-execution) |
| **Create a Schedule** | At least one active Schedule exists | [Creating a Schedule](/docs/getting-started/creating-a-schedule) |
| **Connect Slack** | Slack workspace is connected and a default channel is set | [Connecting Slack](/docs/getting-started/connecting-slack) |
| **Invite a team member** | At least one invitation has been sent or accepted | [Settings](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/team) |


---

## Dismissing the checklist

Once all steps are complete, the checklist auto-collapses. You can also dismiss it early by clicking the **Dismiss** button in the widget header — useful for experienced teams who have already completed setup before the checklist was introduced.

> **Tip**
Dismissing the checklist is a per-user action. Other team members will still see their own checklist until they complete or dismiss it.


---

## Resetting the checklist

If you need to revisit the checklist after dismissing it, navigate to **Settings** > **Dashboard** and toggle **Show onboarding checklist** back on.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/dashboard/projected-vs-actual-savings

# Projected vs Actual Savings

The projected vs actual savings chart on the Dashboard compares what your Schedules are expected to save against the savings measured from completed Executions. This helps you understand whether your automation is delivering the value you expect.


---

## How projected savings are calculated

Projected savings are estimated using:

- **Resource hourly cost** — The on-demand rate for each resource in the Target
- **Schedule duration** — How long resources are stopped or scaled down per Schedule cycle
- **Resource count** — The number of matched resources in each Target

For example, if a Target contains 5 EC2 instances costing $0.10/hr each, and the Schedule stops them for 14 hours per weekday, the projected daily saving is 5 × $0.10 × 14 = **$7.00**.

> **Note**
Projected savings use on-demand pricing. If your resources are covered by Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, actual savings may differ from projections.


---

## How actual savings are measured

Actual savings are calculated from completed Execution results. When an Execution successfully stops or scales down a resource, frugally.app records the duration the resource remained in the reduced state and multiplies it by the resource's hourly cost.

Actual savings only count time where resources were **confirmed stopped or scaled** — if an Execution fails or a resource is manually restarted, that time is excluded.

---

## Filters and controls

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Date range** | Last 7 days, last 30 days, this month, last month, custom range |
| **Connection** | Filter by one or more AWS Connections |
| **Service** | Filter by AWS service type (EC2, RDS, ECS, etc.) |

---

## Reading the chart

The chart displays two data series:

- **Projected** (dashed line) — Expected savings based on active Schedules and current Target configurations
- **Actual** (solid line) — Measured savings from completed Executions

When the actual line is significantly below the projected line, common causes include:

- **Failed Executions** — Check the [Executions page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions) for errors
- **Resources already stopped** — Resources were in the desired state before the Execution ran
- **Target configuration changes** — Resources were added or removed from Targets mid-period
- **Manual interventions** — Resources were started manually outside of frugally.app

> **Tip**
A healthy setup shows the actual and projected lines tracking closely. If they diverge consistently, review your Target configurations and Execution history to identify the cause.

If no channel is specified, notifications go to the default channel. If no default is set, notifications are only visible in the web dashboard.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/integrations/slack/slash-commands

# Slash Commands

frugally.app registers the `/frugally` slash command in your Slack workspace. Use it to trigger Executions, check status, and interact with your cloud automation without leaving Slack.

---

## Command reference

### `/frugally run`

Trigger a manual Execution against a Target.

```
/frugally run <target-name> <action>
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `target-name` | The name of the Target (use quotes if it contains spaces) |
| `action` | The action to perform: `stop`, `start`, `scale-up`, `scale-down`, `enable`, `disable`, `create`, `delete` |

**Examples:**

```
/frugally run "Dev EC2 eu-west-1" stop
/frugally run "Staging RDS" start
/frugally run "Dev ECS Services" scale-down
```

Results are posted to the channel where you ran the command.

---

### `/frugally dry-run`

Simulate an Execution without making changes. See [Dry Runs](/docs/automate/targets/dry-runs) for details.

```
/frugally dry-run <target-name> <action>
```

**Example:**

```
/frugally dry-run "Dev EC2 eu-west-1" stop
```

---

### `/frugally status`

Check the status of recent Executions or a specific Target.

```
/frugally status
/frugally status <target-name>
```

| Usage | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| `/frugally status` | Summary of the 5 most recent Executions across all Targets |
| `/frugally status "Dev EC2 eu-west-1"` | Latest Execution and current resource state for the specified Target |

---

### `/frugally schedules`

List active Schedules and their next run times.

```
/frugally schedules
/frugally schedules <target-name>
```

| Usage | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| `/frugally schedules` | All active Schedules with next run times |
| `/frugally schedules "Dev EC2 eu-west-1"` | Schedules linked to the specified Target |

---

### `/frugally savings`

Show a savings summary for the current period.

```
/frugally savings
/frugally savings <period>
```

| Period | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `today` | Savings for today |
| `week` | Savings for the current week |
| `month` | Savings for the current month (default) |

**Example:**

```
/frugally savings week
```

---

### `/frugally help`

Display a list of available commands with brief descriptions.

```
/frugally help
```

---

## Command behaviour

### Permissions

Slash commands respect the user's frugally.app [role and scopes](/docs/roles-and-access/overview). A Viewer cannot run `/frugally run`, and a Member scoped to non-production Connections cannot trigger Executions against production Targets.

If a user lacks permission, Slack responds with an ephemeral message (visible only to them) explaining why the command was denied.

### Response format

- **Ephemeral messages** — Confirmations and errors are shown only to the user who ran the command
- **Channel messages** — Execution results and status updates are posted to the channel so the whole team can see them
- **Threaded replies** — Detailed results (per-resource breakdown) are posted as a thread under the main result message

### Error handling

| Error | Slack response |
|-------|----------------|
| Target not found | "Target not found. Check the name and try again." |
| Invalid action | "Invalid action for this service type. Available actions: stop, start" |
| Permission denied | "You don't have permission to run Executions. Contact your Admin." |
| Execution failed | Error details posted to the channel with a link to the full Execution detail |

> **Tip**
Use double quotes around Target names that contain spaces. If you are unsure of a Target's exact name, use `/frugally status` to see a list.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/integrations/slack/app-mentions-and-ai-intent

# App Mentions & AI Intent

Mention `@frugally` in any channel where the app is installed and ask a question in natural language. frugally.app uses AI intent parsing to understand your question and respond with relevant data.

---

## How it works

1. Type `@frugally` followed by your question in a Slack channel
2. frugally.app parses the intent of your message
3. It queries the relevant data (costs, Executions, Schedules, resources, etc.)
4. A response is posted in the channel

No slash command syntax required — just ask in plain English.

---

## Supported queries

### Cost questions

| Example | What it returns |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@frugally how much did we spend this month?` | Total AWS spend for the current month |
| `@frugally what's our EC2 cost this week?` | EC2 spend for the current week |
| `@frugally are we over budget?` | Budget status for all active budgets |
| `@frugally what are our top 5 most expensive services?` | Top services ranked by spend |
| `@frugally compare this month to last month` | Month-over-month spend comparison |

### Execution questions

| Example | What it returns |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@frugally what happened last run?` | Summary of the most recent Execution |
| `@frugally did the dev environment stop last night?` | Status of the last Execution against dev Targets |
| `@frugally any failed executions today?` | List of failed Executions from today |
| `@frugally how much have we saved this week?` | Savings from completed Executions this week |

### Schedule questions

| Example | What it returns |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@frugally when does the dev environment stop?` | Next scheduled stop time for dev Targets |
| `@frugally what schedules are active?` | List of active Schedules with next run times |
| `@frugally is anything scheduled for tonight?` | Executions scheduled for the remainder of today |

### Resource questions

| Example | What it returns |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@frugally how many EC2 instances are running?` | Count of running EC2 instances across all Connections |
| `@frugally which resources are not in any target?` | Resources not covered by any Target |
| `@frugally what's the status of the staging RDS?` | Current state of RDS resources in staging Targets |

---

## Response format

Responses are posted as channel messages and include:

- **Direct answer** — The data requested in a readable format
- **Source** — Which data source was queried (Cost Explorer, Executions, Schedules, etc.)
- **Link** — A link to the full detail in the web dashboard for further exploration
- **Caveats** — Any limitations (e.g. "Cost data is up to 24 hours behind")


---

## Tips for effective queries

- **Be specific about time** — "this month", "last week", "today" help frugally.app return the right data range
- **Name resources** — Use Target names or service names to narrow results
- **Ask follow-ups** — Mention `@frugally` again in a thread to ask a follow-up question with context from the previous response
- **Use channels appropriately** — Responses are visible to everyone in the channel. For sensitive cost data, use a private channel or DM

---

## What AI intent cannot do

AI intent is **read-only**. It can answer questions about your data but cannot:

- Trigger Executions (use `/frugally run` for that)
- Create or modify Targets, Schedules, or Budgets
- Change settings or configurations

If frugally.app cannot understand your query, it responds with a suggestion to rephrase or a link to the relevant dashboard page.

> **Tip**
If frugally.app misunderstands your query, try rephrasing with more explicit keywords. For example, instead of "what's happening?" try "what executions ran today?"

The Home Tab is designed as a quick-glance overview. For detailed analysis and management, use the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/integrations/slack/reactions-and-workflows

# Reactions and Workflows

frugally.app supports emoji reactions as action triggers and integrates with Slack Workflow Builder for custom automation flows.

---

## Emoji reactions

### How reactions work

When frugally.app posts an Execution result or a Guard notification to a Slack channel, team members can react with specific emoji to trigger actions.

| Emoji | Action | Applies to |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` | Approve a Guard Project | Guard Project submission notifications |
| :x: `:x:` | Reject a Guard Project | Guard Project submission notifications |
| :arrows_counterclockwise: `:arrows_counterclockwise:` | Re-run the Execution | Execution result messages |
| :mag: `:mag:` | Get detailed results | Execution result messages (posts a threaded reply with per-resource breakdown) |

### Permissions

Reactions respect the user's frugally.app role:

- **Approve/Reject** — Only users who are valid approvers for the Project (based on [approval rules](/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules)) can approve or reject via reaction
- **Re-run** — Only Members and above can trigger a re-run
- **Details** — Any team member can request detailed results

If a user without the required permission reacts, frugally.app sends an ephemeral message explaining that the action was not taken.

### Enabling reactions

Emoji reactions are enabled by default. To disable them, navigate to **Settings** > **Slack** > **Reactions** and toggle them off.

> **Tip**
Emoji reactions make Guard approvals fast and visible to the whole team. Instead of switching to the dashboard, approvers can review the notification and react directly in the channel.

## Slack Workflow Builder integration

frugally.app can be used as a step in Slack Workflow Builder, allowing you to create custom automation flows that combine frugally.app actions with other Slack and third-party tools.

### Available workflow steps

| Step | Description | Inputs |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Run Execution** | Triggers a manual Execution | Target name, action |
| **Run Dry Run** | Triggers a dry run | Target name, action |
| **Get Savings** | Fetches savings data for a period | Period (today, week, month) |
| **Get Schedule Status** | Fetches upcoming schedule information | Target name (optional) |

### Example workflows

#### Scheduled cost report

Send a weekly savings summary to a finance channel every Monday morning:

1. **Trigger:** Scheduled (every Monday at 9 AM)
2. **Step 1:** frugally.app — Get Savings (period: week)
3. **Step 2:** Send message to #finance-updates with savings data

#### Approval escalation

Escalate a Guard Project that has not been approved within 4 hours:

1. **Trigger:** frugally.app posts a Guard Project notification
2. **Step 1:** Wait 4 hours
3. **Step 2:** Check if the Project is still pending
4. **Step 3:** If pending, send a reminder to the #platform-leads channel

#### Emergency shutdown

Allow on-call engineers to trigger an emergency shutdown from a specific channel:

1. **Trigger:** New message in #incidents containing "shutdown"
2. **Step 1:** frugally.app — Run Execution (Target: "All Non-Prod", action: stop)
3. **Step 2:** Post confirmation to #incidents

### Setting up workflows

1. Open **Slack Workflow Builder** (from the Slack sidebar: Automations > Workflows)
2. Create a new workflow or edit an existing one
3. Add a step and search for "frugally" in the step library
4. Select the frugally.app step and configure its inputs
5. Publish the workflow

> **Note**
Workflow Builder integration requires the Slack workspace to be on a Slack paid plan. The frugally.app steps are available on the Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Integrations — GitHub

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/integrations/github/overview

# GitHub Integration Overview

The GitHub integration connects frugally.app to your Infrastructure-as-Code repositories. It scans pull requests for cost impact, detects drift between IaC definitions and live AWS resources, and tracks infrastructure authorship for cost attribution.

---

## Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Installation](./installation.md)** | Install and configure the GitHub App for your organisation |
| **[IaC Scanning](./iac-scanning.md)** | Scan PRs for Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK, Pulumi, and OpenTofu changes with cost-impact analysis |
| **[Drift Detection](./drift-detection.md)** | Compare IaC definitions against live AWS state and alert on mismatches |
| **[PR Review & Authorship](./pr-review-and-authorship.md)** | Automated cost-impact comments on PRs and infrastructure change tracking |

---

## Supported IaC frameworks

| Framework | File patterns | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Terraform** | `*.tf`, `*.tf.json` | HCL and JSON formats |
| **CloudFormation** | `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.json` (with AWSTemplateFormatVersion) | YAML and JSON templates |
| **AWS CDK** | `cdk.out/**/*.template.json` | Synthesised CloudFormation templates |
| **Pulumi** | `Pulumi.yaml`, `*.ts`, `*.py`, `*.go` | Pulumi project files |
| **OpenTofu** | `*.tf`, `*.tf.json` | Same syntax as Terraform |

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub organisation admin access (to approve the App installation)
- At least one repository containing IaC files
- A frugally.app account with Admin or Owner role

For initial setup, see [Getting Started — Connecting GitHub](/docs/getting-started/connecting-github).

---

## Required GitHub App permissions

The frugally.app GitHub App requests:

| Permission | Access | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Repository contents** | Read | Read IaC files for scanning and drift detection |
| **Pull requests** | Read & Write | Post cost-impact comments on PRs |
| **Issues** | Read | Reference issues linked to infrastructure changes |
| **Checks** | Read & Write | Report scan results as GitHub check runs |
| **Metadata** | Read | Access repository metadata |

> **Note**
frugally.app only accesses the repositories you grant it access to during installation. It does not read source code unrelated to infrastructure definitions.


---

## What GitHub can and cannot do

### Can do
- Scan IaC files in PRs for cost impact
- Detect drift between IaC and live AWS state
- Post automated review comments with cost estimates
- Track who changed infrastructure and when
- Report results as GitHub check runs

### Cannot do
- Modify repository contents or merge PRs
- Access source code unrelated to IaC files
- Create, edit, or delete frugally.app resources (Connections, Targets, Schedules)
- Manage billing, team members, or settings

All management is done on the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app).

# GitHub App Installation

This guide covers the detailed installation process for the frugally.app GitHub App, including organisation-level vs repository-level installation and managing access after setup.

For the quick-start version, see [Getting Started — Connecting GitHub](/docs/getting-started/connecting-github).

---

## Installation options

### Organisation-level installation (recommended)

Install the App at the organisation level and choose which repositories to grant access to. This is the recommended approach because:

- Centralised management — Admins control access from one place
- Easy to add new repositories later without reinstalling
- Works with organisation-wide security policies

### Repository-level installation

Install the App on individual repositories. Use this if:

- You do not have organisation admin access
- You want to limit the App to specific repositories only
- Your organisation's policies do not allow organisation-level App installations

---

## Installation steps

### 1. Start the installation

Navigate to **Settings** > **Install GitHub App** in the frugally.app dashboard.

[Install GitHub App](https://dashboard.frugally.app/github/install)

Click **Install GitHub App** to be redirected to GitHub.

### 2. Select your organisation

If you belong to multiple GitHub organisations, select the one you want to connect to frugally.app.


### 3. Choose repository access

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All repositories** | The App has access to all current and future repositories in the organisation |
| **Only select repositories** | The App has access only to the repositories you choose |

> **Tip**
Start with **Only select repositories** and add the repositories that contain your IaC files. You can grant access to more repositories later without reinstalling.


### 4. Review permissions

GitHub displays the permissions the App is requesting. Review them and click **Install**.

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Repository contents (Read) | Read IaC files for scanning |
| Pull requests (Read & Write) | Post cost-impact review comments |
| Checks (Read & Write) | Report scan results as check runs |
| Issues (Read) | Reference linked issues |
| Metadata (Read) | Access repository names and settings |

### 5. Confirm in frugally.app

You are redirected back to the frugally.app dashboard. The status shows **Connected** with the list of accessible repositories.


---

## Managing repository access after installation

### Adding repositories

1. Go to your GitHub organisation's **Settings** > **Installed GitHub Apps**
2. Find **frugally.app** and click **Configure**
3. Under **Repository access**, add the new repositories
4. Save changes

The new repositories are available in frugally.app immediately.

### Removing repositories

Follow the same steps as adding, but remove repositories from the access list instead. Removing a repository:

- Stops IaC scanning on new PRs for that repository
- Stops drift detection for resources defined in that repository
- Does not delete historical scan results or findings

---

## Multiple organisations

frugally.app supports connecting multiple GitHub organisations. Each organisation requires a separate App installation. To connect an additional organisation:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Install GitHub App** in the dashboard
2. Click **Install to Another Organisation**
3. Follow the installation steps for the new organisation

---

## Uninstalling the GitHub App

To disconnect GitHub entirely:

1. Go to your GitHub organisation's **Settings** > **Installed GitHub Apps**
2. Find **frugally.app** and click **Configure**
3. Click **Uninstall** at the bottom of the page

This removes all access. In frugally.app, the GitHub integration status changes to **Not Connected**. Historical scan results and findings are retained.

---

## Troubleshooting installation

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| **"Insufficient permissions"** | You need organisation admin access. Ask your GitHub org admin to install the App. |
| **Organisation not listed** | Ensure you are a member of the organisation. If it uses SAML SSO, you may need to authorise the App separately. |
| **Installation succeeds but no repositories shown** | Check that you selected repositories during installation. Go to GitHub > Installed Apps > frugally.app > Configure to verify. |
| **Status stuck on "Connecting"** | Try refreshing the frugally.app dashboard. If the issue persists, uninstall and reinstall the App. |

# IaC Scanning

IaC scanning analyses Infrastructure-as-Code changes in pull requests and reports the estimated cost impact. It helps your team understand the financial implications of infrastructure changes before they are merged.

---

## How scanning works

1. A developer opens or updates a pull request that modifies IaC files
2. frugally.app detects the change and scans the affected files
3. It compares the proposed infrastructure against current state
4. A cost-impact analysis is calculated and posted as a PR comment
5. A GitHub check run reports the scan status (pass/fail)


---

## Supported frameworks

| Framework | Detected by |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Terraform** | `.tf` and `.tf.json` files |
| **CloudFormation** | Templates with `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` |
| **AWS CDK** | Synthesised templates in `cdk.out/` |
| **Pulumi** | `Pulumi.yaml` project files |
| **OpenTofu** | `.tf` and `.tf.json` files (same as Terraform) |

Scanning is triggered for any PR that modifies files matching these patterns in repositories where the GitHub App has access.

---

## Scan triggers

| Event | Scan triggered? |
|-------|----------------|
| PR opened | Yes |
| PR updated (new commits pushed) | Yes |
| PR reopened | Yes |
| Draft PR opened | Configurable (default: no) |
| PR to specific branches only | Configurable (default: all branches) |

Configure triggers at **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Scan Triggers**.

---

## Cost-impact analysis

The scan compares the proposed changes against the current infrastructure and estimates the cost impact:

| Change type | Example | Impact |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **New resource** | Adding an EC2 instance | Monthly cost increase |
| **Modified resource** | Upgrading instance type from t3.small to t3.large | Cost difference (increase or decrease) |
| **Removed resource** | Deleting an RDS instance | Monthly cost decrease |
| **No cost impact** | Changing a tag or description | $0 impact |

The PR comment shows:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Summary** | Total estimated monthly cost change (e.g. "+$150/month") |
| **Breakdown** | Per-resource cost changes |
| **Current cost** | What the infrastructure costs today |
| **Proposed cost** | What it would cost after the change |

---

## Configuring scan rules

Navigate to **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Scan Rules** to configure:

### Thresholds

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Cost increase warning** | Flag PRs that increase costs above this amount | $50/month |
| **Cost increase block** | Fail the check run for PRs above this amount | Disabled |
| **Require approval for high-cost changes** | Link to Guard [approval rules](/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules) | Disabled |

### Exclusions

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Excluded paths** | File paths to skip during scanning (e.g. `tests/`, `examples/`) |
| **Excluded resources** | Resource types to exclude from cost analysis |
| **Excluded branches** | Branches where scanning is disabled |

---

## Check run status

frugally.app reports scan results as a GitHub check run:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Passed** | Cost impact is within configured thresholds |
| **Warning** | Cost impact exceeds the warning threshold |
| **Failed** | Cost impact exceeds the block threshold |
| **Skipped** | No IaC changes detected in the PR |

You can require the frugally.app check to pass before merging by adding it as a required status check in your branch protection rules.

> **Tip**
Start with warning thresholds only. Once your team is comfortable with the scan results, consider adding a block threshold for large cost increases to prevent surprises.


---

## Scan accuracy

Cost estimates are based on AWS on-demand pricing for the region specified in the IaC files. Factors that can affect accuracy:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Dynamic values** | Variables resolved at apply-time (e.g. instance count from a variable) use default values |
| **Modules** | Nested modules are resolved and costed individually |
| **Conditional resources** | Resources behind `count = 0` or `for_each` with empty sets are excluded |
| **Data transfer** | Data transfer costs are not estimated (they depend on runtime usage) |
| **Free tier** | AWS Free Tier is not factored into estimates |

# Drift Detection

Drift detection compares your Infrastructure-as-Code definitions against the live state of your AWS resources. When the two diverge — for example, someone changes a resource manually in the AWS console — frugally.app flags it as drift and alerts your team.

---

## What drift is

**Drift** occurs when the actual state of an AWS resource no longer matches what your IaC code defines. Common causes:

| Cause | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Manual console change** | Someone changes an instance type in the AWS console without updating Terraform |
| **Emergency fix** | A security group rule is added manually during an incident and never back-ported to code |
| **Automation outside IaC** | A Lambda function is updated by a CI/CD pipeline that does not go through the IaC workflow |
| **AWS auto-scaling** | Auto Scaling changes desired capacity, which differs from the IaC-defined value |

---

## How drift detection works

1. frugally.app reads your IaC definitions from the connected GitHub repositories
2. It queries the live state of the corresponding AWS resources via your [Connections](/docs/getting-started/connecting-your-aws-accounts)
3. It compares the two and identifies differences
4. Drift is reported as alerts with severity levels

---

## Drift detection frequency

| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Scheduled** | Runs automatically on a configurable schedule (default: daily at 6 AM UTC) |
| **On-demand** | Triggered manually from **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Run Drift Detection** |
| **Post-merge** | Runs automatically after a PR containing IaC changes is merged |

Configure the schedule at **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Drift Detection**.

---

## Drift alerts

When drift is detected, frugally.app creates an alert with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Resource** | The AWS resource that has drifted |
| **IaC definition** | What the code says the resource should look like |
| **Live state** | What the resource actually looks like in AWS |
| **Diff** | A side-by-side comparison of the differences |
| **Severity** | Based on the type and impact of the drift |
| **Repository** | Which IaC repository defines the resource |
| **File** | The specific file and line number |

### Severity levels

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Security-related drift (e.g. security group rules changed, encryption disabled) |
| **High** | Cost-impacting drift (e.g. instance type upgraded, additional resources created) |
| **Medium** | Configuration drift that may affect behaviour (e.g. environment variables changed) |
| **Low** | Cosmetic drift (e.g. tags changed, descriptions updated) |

---

## Alert delivery

Drift alerts are delivered through:

| Channel | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| **In-app** | Always enabled — alerts appear in the dashboard under Guard |
| **Slack** | Posted to the configured Guard channel |
| **GitHub** | Posted as an issue or PR comment in the affected repository |
| **Email** | Based on user notification preferences |

---

## Remediation options

When drift is detected, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Update IaC** | Modify your code to match the live state (accept the manual change) |
| **Revert in AWS** | Change the AWS resource back to match the IaC definition |
| **Create a Guard Project** | Propose a formal change through the [approval workflow](/docs/guard/projects/workflow) |
| **Dismiss** | Mark the drift as accepted with a reason (e.g. "Expected — auto-scaling behaviour") |

---

## Configuring drift detection

Navigate to **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Drift Detection**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Schedule** | How often drift detection runs (hourly, daily, weekly, custom CRON) |
| **Repositories** | Which repositories to include in drift detection |
| **Resource types** | Which AWS resource types to check (default: all) |
| **Exclusions** | Specific resources or attributes to exclude (e.g. auto-scaling desired capacity) |
| **Severity thresholds** | Minimum severity to create alerts |

> **Tip**
Exclude attributes that change frequently by design (like Auto Scaling desired capacity or ECS running task count) to reduce noise. Focus drift detection on attributes that should only change through code.


---

## Drift detection and frugally.app Automate

frugally.app Automate actions (stopping, starting, scaling resources) are **not flagged as drift** by default. frugally.app recognises its own actions and excludes them from drift comparisons. If you want to include Automate-caused state changes in drift detection, enable this in **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Drift Detection** > **Include Automate actions**.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/integrations/github/pr-review-and-authorship

# PR Review and Authorship

frugally.app participates in pull request reviews by posting cost-impact comments on infrastructure changes. It also tracks infrastructure authorship — who changed what — for cost attribution and audit purposes.

---

## PR cost-impact reviews

When a PR modifies Infrastructure-as-Code files, frugally.app automatically posts a review comment summarising the cost impact. This is powered by [IaC Scanning](./iac-scanning.md) and gives reviewers immediate visibility into the financial implications of the change.

### What the review comment contains

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Cost summary** | Total estimated monthly cost change (increase, decrease, or neutral) |
| **Resource breakdown** | Per-resource cost changes (new, modified, or removed) |
| **Current vs proposed** | Side-by-side comparison of current and proposed monthly costs |
| **Confidence** | How confident the estimate is based on available data |


### Review comment behaviour

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **When to comment** | Every PR with IaC changes (default), only when cost increases, or only above a threshold |
| **Comment style** | Summary only, or summary with per-resource breakdown |
| **Update on push** | Update the existing comment when new commits are pushed (default) or post a new comment |

Configure at **Settings** > **GitHub** > **PR Reviews**.

---

## Inline annotations

In addition to the summary comment, frugally.app can post inline review annotations on specific lines of code:

| Annotation type | When it appears |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Cost increase** | A line that adds or modifies a resource, increasing cost |
| **Cost decrease** | A line that removes or downsizes a resource, decreasing cost |
| **Cost warning** | A line that changes an expensive resource type or region |
| **Best practice** | A suggestion for a more cost-effective configuration |

Inline annotations appear in the GitHub PR "Files changed" tab, directly on the relevant lines.

> **Tip**
Inline annotations help reviewers understand the cost impact of specific changes without reading the full summary. They are especially useful in large PRs with many resource changes.


---

## Authorship tracking

frugally.app tracks who creates, modifies, and deletes infrastructure resources through pull requests. This data feeds into Guard's [Cost Attribution](/docs/guard/cost-attribution) to help answer "who is responsible for this cost?"

### What is tracked

| Data point | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| **Author** | The PR author (mapped to a frugally.app user via GitHub username) |
| **Timestamp** | When the PR was merged |
| **Resources affected** | Which AWS resources were created, modified, or deleted |
| **Cost impact** | The estimated cost change from the PR |
| **Repository and file** | Where the change was made |

### How authorship data is used

| Feature | How it uses authorship |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Cost Attribution** | Attributes resource costs to the team or user who created them |
| **Guard Projects** | Links infrastructure changes back to the PR and author |
| **Resource History** | Shows the PR that introduced or modified a resource in [Resource History](/docs/guard/resource-history-and-locks) |
| **Executive Dashboard** | Aggregates cost-impact data by team and individual |

---

## Configuring review behaviour

Navigate to **Settings** > **GitHub** > **PR Reviews**:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable PR reviews** | Post cost-impact comments on PRs | Enabled |
| **Enable inline annotations** | Post inline code annotations | Enabled |
| **Comment threshold** | Minimum cost change to trigger a comment | $0 (always comment) |
| **Track authorship** | Record who changed which resources | Enabled |
| **Map GitHub users** | Map GitHub usernames to frugally.app users | Auto-mapped by email |

### User mapping

frugally.app maps GitHub users to frugally.app users by matching email addresses. If a GitHub user's email does not match any frugally.app user:

- Authorship is recorded with the GitHub username
- Cost attribution falls back to the repository or team level
- You can manually map users at **Settings** > **GitHub** > **User Mapping**

---

## Requiring cost review

To ensure every infrastructure PR is cost-reviewed before merging:

1. Add the frugally.app check as a **required status check** in your branch protection rules
2. Set a cost increase threshold that fails the check (in [IaC Scanning](./iac-scanning.md) settings)
3. Optionally, require a Guard [Project approval](/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules) for PRs above a certain cost threshold

This creates a workflow where infrastructure changes cannot be merged without cost visibility and, for high-cost changes, without formal approval.


---

## Roles & Access

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/roles-and-access/overview

# Roles & Access Overview

frugally.app uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model to manage what team members can see and do. Roles define permissions, [Groups](./groups.md) organise users, and [Scopes](./scopes.md) restrict visibility to specific parts of your AWS environment.

---

## How roles, groups, and scopes interact

```
Users → Roles (what they can do)
Users → Groups → Scopes (what they can see)
```

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **[Roles](./roles-and-permissions.md)** | Define what actions a user can perform (create Targets, approve Projects, manage billing, etc.) |
| **[Groups](./groups.md)** | Organise users into teams for shared access and notification policies |
| **[Scopes](./scopes.md)** | Restrict what Connections, Targets, and Schedules a Group or user can access |

---

## Quick reference

| Role | Create & edit Targets | Run Executions | Manage Schedules | Approve Projects | Manage team | Manage billing |
|------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Owner** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Admin** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Member** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Viewer** | No | No | No | No | No | No |

For full details, see [Roles and Permissions](./roles-and-permissions.md).

---

## Common configurations

### Small team (2–5 people)

Everyone is an Admin or Member. No Groups or Scopes needed — everyone sees everything.

### Medium team (5–20 people)

Create Groups by function (e.g. Backend, Frontend, Platform). Assign Connection-level Scopes so each team sees only their AWS accounts. Admins see everything.

### Large / enterprise team (20+ people)

Use Groups synced from Slack (Pro) or provisioned via SCIM (Enterprise). Assign granular Target-level Scopes. Use Guard [approval rules](/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules) tied to Groups for change governance.

---

## In this section

- **[Roles and Permissions](./roles-and-permissions.md)** — Full permission matrix for each role
- **[Groups](./groups.md)** — Organise users into teams
- **[Scopes](./scopes.md)** — Restrict access to specific Connections, Targets, or environments
- **[Access Requests](./access-requests.md)** — Request and grant elevated access


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions

# Roles and Permissions

Every frugally.app user is assigned a role that determines what actions they can perform. Roles are set at the team level — a user has the same role across all Connections, though [Scopes](./scopes.md) can further restrict what they can see.

---

## Available roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to everything, including billing and team ownership transfer. Only one user can be the Owner. |
| **Admin** | Full access to all features except billing management and ownership transfer. Can manage team members and roles. |
| **Member** | Can create and manage Targets, Schedules, and Executions. Cannot manage team settings or approve Guard Projects. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access. Can view Targets, Schedules, Executions, and dashboards but cannot make changes. |

---

---

## Assigning and changing roles

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team Members**
2. Find the user and click their current role
3. Select the new role from the dropdown
4. Save

Only Owners and Admins can change roles. The Owner role can only be transferred — not assigned to multiple users.

> **Note**
Changing a user's role takes effect immediately. The user's current session is updated without requiring them to sign out.


---

## Role inheritance with Groups

Roles and [Groups](./groups.md) are independent. A user's role defines what they **can do**, while their Group memberships (via Scopes) define what they **can see**. A Member in a Group with a narrow Scope can still create Targets — but only within the Connections visible to their Scope.

---

## Scope bypass

Admins and Owners bypass all [Scope](./scopes.md) restrictions. They always have full visibility across all Connections, Targets, and Schedules. This ensures administrators can manage the entire environment without being limited by Scope assignments.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/roles-and-access/groups

# Groups

Groups let you organise your team members within frugally.app. Use them to control who can see and act on specific parts of your AWS environment by assigning Scopes.

## Group types

frugally.app supports two types of Group:

### Manual Groups

Create a Group from the dashboard and add members by hand. This is the simplest option and works for any team size.

[Manage Groups](https://dashboard.frugally.app/groups)

- Give the Group a name (e.g. `Backend Team`, `Platform Engineering`)
- Add or remove members at any time from the Group detail page

### Synced from Slack (Pro)

> **Pro feature**
Slack-synced Groups are available on the **Pro** plan.


Link a frugally.app Group to a Slack user group. Membership stays in sync automatically — when someone is added to or removed from the Slack user group, the frugally.app Group updates to match.

This is useful when your Slack user groups already reflect your team structure and you want to avoid maintaining membership in two places.

## Scopes

Scopes can be assigned to Groups to control what Connections, Targets, and Schedules the Group's members can access. This lets you restrict visibility so that, for example, a development team only sees their own Connections and Targets while a platform team has access to everything.

See [Scopes](scopes.md) for full details.

## SCIM provisioning (Enterprise)

> **Enterprise feature**
SCIM provisioning is available on the **Enterprise** plan.


Enterprise customers using an identity provider that supports SCIM (such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or OneLogin) can automatically provision and deprovision Groups and their memberships. When a group is created, updated, or deleted in your identity provider, the change is reflected in frugally.app without any manual steps.

See [SCIM Provisioning](../sso/scim-provisioning.md) for setup instructions.

# Scopes

> **Pro feature**
Scopes are available on the **Pro** plan and above.


Scopes control what your team members can see and act on inside frugally.app. Assign a Scope to a [Group](groups.md) or an individual user to restrict their access to specific parts of your AWS environment.

[Manage Scopes](https://dashboard.frugally.app/scopes)

## Scope types

Every Scope has a type that determines how it restricts access. There are three types, ranging from broad to narrow:

### Environment

Restrict access by the environment label on your Connections — **Production** or **Non-Production**. This is the broadest scope type.

For example, an Environment scope set to `Non-Production` lets members access every Target belonging to a Connection tagged as non-production, across all AWS accounts.

### Connection

Restrict access to one or more specific Connections. Any Target that belongs to a scoped Connection is accessible; everything else is hidden.

Use this when you want a team to see only the AWS accounts they work in.

### Target

Restrict access to one or more specific Targets. This is the most granular scope type — members see only the exact Targets listed.

Use this when different teams share the same AWS account but manage different resources.

## How Scopes restrict Targets

When frugally.app checks whether a user can access a Target, it evaluates the user's Scopes using a **specificity hierarchy** — most specific match wins:

1. **Target scope** — Does any Scope include this exact Target? If yes, access is granted.
2. **Connection scope** — Does any Scope include the Target's Connection? If yes, access is granted.
3. **Environment scope** — Does any Scope include the Connection's environment? If yes, access is granted.

A match at **any** level is enough to grant access. If no Scope matches at any level, the Target is hidden and the user cannot run Executions against it.

### Example

| Scope type | Scope value | Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Environment | `Non-Production` | User can access all Targets in every non-production Connection |
| Connection | `Dev Account (123456789012)` | User can access all Targets in that specific Connection |
| Target | `Dev EC2 eu-west-1` | User can access only that single Target |

## Assigning Scopes

Scopes can be assigned to:

- **Groups** — Every member of the Group inherits the Scope. This is the recommended approach. See [Groups](groups.md).
- **Individual users** — For one-off exceptions where a Group doesn't make sense.

When a user has multiple Scopes (directly and via Groups), they are merged with **OR logic** — the user gets the combined access of all their Scopes.

Team admins bypass Scope checks entirely and always have full access.

## Creating a Scope

1. Navigate to **Scopes** > **Create Scope** (or use the link above)
2. Give the Scope a **Name** (e.g. `Backend Team — Dev Only`)
3. Choose a **Scope Type** — Environment, Connection, or Target
4. Select the **values** for that type:
   - Environment: choose Production, Non-Production, or both
   - Connection: search and select one or more Connections
   - Target: search and select one or more Targets
5. Save the Scope, then assign it to a Group or user


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/roles-and-access/access-requests

# Access Requests

Access requests let team members request elevated access to Connections, Targets, or features they do not currently have permission to use. Requests go through an approval workflow so that access is granted with oversight.

> **Pro feature**
Access requests are available on the Pro and Enterprise plans.


---

## How access requests work

1. A user encounters a resource or action they cannot access (due to their [Scope](./scopes.md) or [Role](./roles-and-permissions.md))
2. They submit an access request explaining what they need and why
3. An Admin or Owner reviews the request
4. If approved, the user receives the requested access
5. Access can be permanent or time-bound

---

## Submitting a request

When a user tries to access a restricted resource, they see an **Request Access** button. Clicking it opens the request form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Resource** | The Connection, Target, or feature being requested (pre-filled) |
| **Reason** | Why the access is needed (free text) |
| **Duration** | Permanent or time-bound (1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, custom) |

Users can also submit requests proactively from **Settings** > **Access Requests** > **New Request**.

---

## Reviewing requests

Admins and Owners see pending requests at **Settings** > **Access Requests**.

Each request shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Requester** | Who submitted the request |
| **Resource** | What they are requesting access to |
| **Reason** | Their explanation |
| **Requested duration** | How long they need access |
| **Submitted** | When the request was made |

### Approval actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Approve** | Grants the requested access. For Scope-based requests, the user is added to an appropriate Scope. For role-based requests, the role is upgraded. |
| **Approve with modifications** | Grants access but with a different duration or scope than requested |
| **Deny** | Rejects the request with an optional reason |

---

## Time-bound access

When access is granted with a time limit:

- The user receives access immediately
- A countdown is visible on their profile showing when access expires
- When the timer expires, access is automatically revoked
- No manual intervention is needed to remove the access

> **Tip**
Time-bound access is ideal for temporary needs like debugging a production issue or reviewing a specific team's resources. It avoids the risk of permanently over-provisioned permissions.


---

## Notifications

| Event | Who is notified |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Request submitted** | All Admins and the Owner |
| **Request approved** | The requester |
| **Request denied** | The requester (with reason if provided) |
| **Access expiring soon** | The requester (1 hour before expiry) |
| **Access expired** | The requester |

Notifications are delivered via in-app, Slack (if connected), and email based on each user's notification preferences.

---

## Audit trail

All access requests and their outcomes are recorded in the audit log:

- Who requested access, what they requested, and why
- Who approved or denied the request
- When access was granted and when it expired or was revoked
- Any modifications made to the original request

The audit trail is accessible to Admins and Owners at **Settings** > **Audit Log**.

## SSO & Provisioning

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/sso/overview

# SSO & Provisioning Overview

> **Enterprise feature**
SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning are available on the **Enterprise** plan.


Enterprise teams can use **SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On** (SSO) and **SCIM 2.0** provisioning to manage authentication and user lifecycle through their existing identity provider (IdP).

## What is SAML SSO?

SAML SSO lets your team members sign in to frugally.app using your organisation's identity provider instead of a separate email and password. When SSO is enabled, users are redirected to your IdP (e.g. Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, OneLogin, Google Workspace) to authenticate, and are then signed in to frugally.app automatically.

**Key benefits:**

- Centralised access control through your IdP
- Enforced authentication policies (MFA, conditional access, etc.)
- One fewer password for your team to manage
- Automatic account creation via Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning

## What is SCIM?

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) automates user and group provisioning. Instead of manually adding and removing team members in frugally.app, your IdP pushes changes automatically.

**What SCIM handles:**

- **User provisioning** --- Create frugally.app accounts when users are assigned in your IdP
- **User deprovisioning** --- Deactivate access when users are unassigned or removed
- **Group sync** --- Create and manage [Groups](../roles-and-access/groups.md) from your IdP's group assignments
- **Profile updates** --- Keep names and email addresses in sync

## How SSO and SCIM work together

SSO and SCIM are independent features, but they complement each other:

| Setup | Authentication | User lifecycle |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| SSO only | Users sign in via your IdP | You add/remove users manually, or use JIT provisioning |
| SSO + SCIM | Users sign in via your IdP | Your IdP creates, updates, and deactivates users automatically |

When SCIM is enabled, JIT provisioning is automatically disabled. Users must be provisioned through SCIM before they can sign in via SSO. This ensures your IdP remains the single source of truth for team membership.

## Supported identity providers

frugally.app supports any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider. Common providers include:

- **Okta**
- **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD)
- **OneLogin**
- **Google Workspace**
- **JumpCloud**
- **PingOne / PingFederate**

For SCIM, any provider that supports the SCIM 2.0 protocol (RFC 7643 / RFC 7644) is compatible.

## What you will need

Before you begin, confirm that you have:

- An **Enterprise** plan (contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) to upgrade)
- **Admin access** to your IdP to create SAML applications and configure SCIM
- **Admin role** in frugally.app with SSO configuration permissions
- **DNS access** to your email domain for domain verification

## Next steps

1. **[Set up SAML SSO](setting-up-saml-sso.md)** --- Configure your IdP, verify your domain, and enable SSO
2. **[Set up SCIM provisioning](scim-provisioning.md)** --- Automate user and group lifecycle management
3. **[Troubleshooting & reference](troubleshooting.md)** --- Diagnostic logs, break-glass recovery, and technical reference


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/sso/setting-up-saml-sso

# Setting Up SAML SSO

> **Enterprise feature**
SAML SSO is available on the **Enterprise** plan.


This guide walks through configuring SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On between your identity provider (IdP) and frugally.app. By the end, your team will be able to sign in using your organisation's IdP.

[Open SSO Settings](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/sso)

## Step 1 --- Gather your Service Provider details

Before configuring your IdP, you need the frugally.app Service Provider (SP) values. These are displayed on the **Configuration** tab in SSO Settings.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SP Entity ID** | `https://dashboard.frugally.app/saml` |
| **ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service) | `https://dashboard.frugally.app/saml/acs` |
| **SLO URL** (Single Logout, optional) | `https://dashboard.frugally.app/saml/{team-slug}/slo` |
| **NameID Format** | `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` |
| **Metadata URL** | `https://dashboard.frugally.app/saml/{team-slug}/metadata` |

Replace `{team-slug}` with your team's slug (visible in the dashboard URL).

> **Tip**
Most IdPs can auto-configure from a metadata URL. Copy your **Metadata URL** and import it in your IdP's SAML app setup.


## Step 2 --- Create a SAML application in your IdP

In your IdP, create a new SAML 2.0 application and enter the SP values from Step 1.

### Attribute mappings

frugally.app expects the following attributes in the SAML assertion. Configure your IdP to release them:

| frugally.app attribute | Description | Common IdP attribute names |
|------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **email** (required) | User's email address | `user.email`, `emailAddress`, `mail`, `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` |
| **name** | Display name | `user.displayName`, `displayName`, `cn` |
| **first_name** | Given name | `user.firstName`, `givenName` |
| **last_name** | Surname | `user.lastName`, `surname`, `sn` |

Only **email** is strictly required. If `name` is not provided, frugally.app will fall back to `first_name` + `last_name`.

frugally.app checks multiple common attribute names automatically, so exact naming is flexible.

### Security requirements

frugally.app enforces the following (these cannot be changed):

- SAML responses **must be signed**
- SAML assertions **must be signed**
- Signature algorithm: **RSA-SHA256** minimum
- Clock skew tolerance: **2 minutes**

## Step 3 --- Enter your IdP details in frugally.app

On the **Configuration** tab, enter the values from your IdP:

- **IdP Entity ID** --- The unique identifier for your IdP (also called Issuer URI)
- **SSO URL** --- The URL where frugally.app sends authentication requests
- **SLO URL** (optional) --- The URL for federated logout

Click **Save Configuration**.

## Step 4 --- Upload your IdP signing certificate

Switch to the **Certificates** tab and paste your IdP's X.509 signing certificate in PEM format.

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICmTCCAYECBgF...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

frugally.app supports multiple certificates for rotation. When your IdP certificate is about to expire, upload the new certificate before removing the old one.

> **Caution**
frugally.app will warn you **30 days** before a certificate expires. If a certificate expires with no valid replacement, SSO authentication will fail.


## Step 5 --- Verify your email domain

Switch to the **Domains** tab. Add each email domain that should use SSO (e.g. `example.com`).

For each domain, frugally.app generates a DNS TXT record you need to add:

| Record type | Host | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| TXT | `_frugally-sso.example.com` | `frugally-sso-verify={verification-token}` |

Add the TXT record in your DNS provider, then click **Verify**. DNS propagation can vary so you may need to wait and retry.

> **Why domain verification?**
Domain verification proves you own the email domain and prevents other organisations from claiming it. Only one organisation can register a domain for SSO at a time.


## Step 6 --- Configure Just-in-Time provisioning

On the **Configuration** tab, decide how new users should be handled:

### JIT provisioning enabled (default)

When a user authenticates via SSO for the first time and does not yet have a frugally.app account, one is created automatically. You can set the **default role** assigned to JIT-provisioned users:

- **View** (default) --- Read-only access
- **Executor** --- Can run executions
- **Writer** --- Can create and edit targets and schedules
- **Admin** --- Full access
- **Billing** --- Billing management only

### JIT provisioning disabled

Users must already exist in frugally.app (added manually or via SCIM) before they can sign in with SSO. Any unrecognised user will be rejected at login.

> **Tip**
If you plan to use [SCIM provisioning](scim-provisioning.md), enable SCIM first. Enabling SCIM automatically disables JIT.


## Step 7 --- Test your configuration

Before enabling SSO for your team, test the configuration:

1. Click **Test SSO** on the Configuration tab
2. You will be redirected to your IdP to authenticate
3. After successful authentication, you are redirected back to frugally.app
4. A successful test marks the configuration as **verified**

If the test fails, check the **Diagnostics** tab for error details. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for common issues.

## Step 8 --- Enable SSO

Once verified, click **Enable SSO**. Your team members can now sign in using SSO.

**Before you can enable SSO, these must be in place:**

- IdP Entity ID and SSO URL configured
- At least one active signing certificate uploaded
- At least one verified email domain
- A successful test completed within the last 24 hours

At this stage, SSO is **optional** --- users can still sign in with email and password.

## Step 9 --- Enforce SSO (optional)

If you want to require SSO for all team members, click **Enforce SSO**. When enforced:

- All users **must** authenticate via your IdP
- Email/password login is blocked for your team
- A **break-glass recovery token** is generated automatically --- store it securely

> **Caution**
Before enforcing SSO, verify that all team members can authenticate through your IdP. Once enforced, the only way to bypass SSO is the break-glass recovery token or an admin bypass.


### Break-glass recovery

When you enforce SSO, frugally.app generates a one-time recovery token. If your IdP goes down or SSO is misconfigured, use the recovery URL to regain access:

```
https://dashboard.frugally.app/auth/saml/recovery/{team-slug}?token={recovery-token}
```

The recovery token is **single-use** and grants a **15-minute window** to log in with email and password. After use, generate a new token from the SSO settings page.

Store your recovery token in a secure location (e.g. a password manager or physical safe) that does not depend on your IdP.

## How sign-in works after setup

### SP-initiated flow (standard)

1. User visits the frugally.app login page and enters their email
2. frugally.app detects the email domain is SSO-enabled and redirects to your IdP
3. The user authenticates with your IdP
4. Your IdP sends a signed SAML assertion back to the frugally.app ACS endpoint
5. frugally.app validates the assertion and signs the user in

### IdP-initiated considerations

frugally.app supports SP-initiated SSO. If your IdP supports sending unsolicited SAML responses, the ACS endpoint will process them, but SP-initiated flow is recommended for security.

# SCIM Provisioning

> **Enterprise feature**
SCIM provisioning is available on the **Enterprise** plan.


SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) automates user and group provisioning between your identity provider and frugally.app. When you add, update, or remove users in your IdP, those changes are reflected in frugally.app automatically.

[Open SSO Settings](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/sso)

## Prerequisites

- [SAML SSO](setting-up-saml-sso.md) configured and enabled (SCIM is managed from the same settings page)
- Admin access to your IdP to configure SCIM provisioning
- Admin role in frugally.app with SSO configuration permissions

## Step 1 --- Enable SCIM

On the SSO settings page, switch to the **Provisioning** tab and click **Enable SCIM**.

> **Caution**
Enabling SCIM automatically **disables JIT provisioning**. From this point, users must be provisioned through SCIM before they can sign in via SSO. Existing team members are not affected.


## Step 2 --- Generate a SCIM token

Click **Generate Token**. A bearer token is displayed once --- copy it immediately and store it securely.

This token authenticates your IdP's SCIM requests to frugally.app.

- Tokens expire after **365 days** by default
- If you need to rotate the token, click **Regenerate** --- the old token is invalidated immediately
- Click **Revoke** to disable the token without generating a new one

## Step 3 --- Configure your IdP

In your IdP's SCIM provisioning settings, enter:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SCIM Base URL** | `https://dashboard.frugally.app/api/scim/v2` |
| **Authentication** | Bearer token |
| **Token** | The token generated in Step 2 |

### IdP-specific notes

**Okta:** Select SCIM 2.0 as the provisioning method. Enable "Push New Users", "Push Profile Updates", and "Push Groups". Set the unique identifier field to `email`.

**Microsoft Entra ID:** Use automatic provisioning. Set the Tenant URL to the SCIM Base URL and enter the token as the Secret Token. Test the connection before saving.

**OneLogin:** Create a SCIM 2.0 connector. Use Bearer token authentication. Enable user and group provisioning under the Provisioning tab.

## Step 4 --- Set the default role

Choose the **default role** for SCIM-provisioned users. This role is assigned when a new user is created through SCIM:

- **View** (default) --- Read-only access
- **Executor** --- Can run executions
- **Writer** --- Can create and edit targets and schedules
- **Admin** --- Full access
- **Billing** --- Billing management only

You can change individual user roles in frugally.app after provisioning.

## Step 5 --- Assign users and groups in your IdP

In your IdP, assign users and groups to the frugally.app application. Your IdP will push these assignments to frugally.app via SCIM.

## What gets provisioned

### Users

When your IdP provisions a user:

1. If the user already has a frugally.app account, they are added to your team
2. If the user is new, an account is created with a verified email and assigned the default role
3. The user's provisioning source is recorded as `scim` in your team membership

When your IdP deprovisions a user:

1. The user is **deactivated** on your team (not deleted)
2. They can no longer sign in via SSO for your team
3. Their frugally.app account and data remain intact

### Groups

SCIM groups map to frugally.app [Groups](../roles-and-access/groups.md). When your IdP pushes a group:

1. A SCIM group record is created in frugally.app
2. You can **map** the SCIM group to a frugally.app Group from the Provisioning tab
3. Once mapped, group membership syncs automatically --- members added or removed in your IdP are reflected in the frugally.app Group
4. You can assign [Scopes](../roles-and-access/scopes.md) to the mapped Group to control access

To map a SCIM group, click **Create & Map** next to the group name on the Provisioning tab. To disconnect, click **Unmap** --- SCIM-sourced members are removed from the platform Group.

> **Tip**
Map your IdP groups to frugally.app Groups to combine SCIM provisioning with Scope-based access control. For example, map an "Engineering" IdP group to a frugally.app Group scoped to your development AWS accounts.


## SCIM API reference

frugally.app implements the SCIM 2.0 protocol (RFC 7643 / RFC 7644). This section is for teams that need to integrate programmatically or troubleshoot API-level issues.

### Base URL

```
https://dashboard.frugally.app/api/scim/v2
```

### Authentication

All requests require a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {scim-token}
```

### Rate limits

SCIM requests are rate-limited to **120 requests per minute**. Exceeding this limit returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### User endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/Users` | Create a user |
| `GET` | `/Users` | List users (supports filter and pagination) |
| `GET` | `/Users/{id}` | Get a single user |
| `PATCH` | `/Users/{id}` | Update user attributes |
| `PUT` | `/Users/{id}` | Replace a user |
| `DELETE` | `/Users/{id}` | Deactivate a user |

### Group endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/Groups` | Create a group |
| `GET` | `/Groups` | List groups (supports filter and pagination) |
| `GET` | `/Groups/{id}` | Get a single group |
| `PATCH` | `/Groups/{id}` | Update group attributes or members |
| `PUT` | `/Groups/{id}` | Replace a group |
| `DELETE` | `/Groups/{id}` | Delete a group |

### Discovery endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/ServiceProviderConfig` | SCIM service provider capabilities |
| `GET` | `/Schemas` | Supported SCIM schemas |
| `GET` | `/ResourceTypes` | Available resource types |

### Filtering

List endpoints support SCIM filter expressions:

```
GET /Users?filter=userName eq "alice@example.com"
GET /Groups?filter=displayName eq "Engineering"
```

Supported filter attributes:
- **Users:** `userName` (email), `externalId`
- **Groups:** `displayName`, `externalId`

### Pagination

List endpoints support pagination via query parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Max | Description |
|-----------|---------|-----|-------------|
| `startIndex` | 1 | --- | 1-based index of the first result |
| `count` | 100 | 500 | Number of results per page |

### User schema

The `userName` field must be a valid email address. Required fields for user creation:

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
  "userName": "alice@example.com",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "Alice",
    "familyName": "Smith"
  },
  "active": true
}
```

### Group schema

Required fields for group creation:

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"],
  "displayName": "Engineering",
  "members": [
    { "value": "{user-id}" }
  ]
}
```

### Error responses

SCIM errors follow the RFC 7644 format:

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error"],
  "detail": "User not found.",
  "status": "404"
}
```

Common status codes:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `400` | Invalid request (missing fields, bad filter syntax) |
| `401` | Invalid or missing token |
| `404` | User or group not found |
| `409` | Conflict (e.g. user already exists with that email) |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal server error |

## Monitoring SCIM sync

The **Diagnostics** tab on the SSO settings page shows recent SCIM events including user provisioning, group changes, and errors.

If SCIM has not synced in over **30 days**, the status shows as stale. Check that your IdP is still sending requests and that the token has not expired.

## Disabling SCIM

Click **Disable SCIM** on the Provisioning tab. This:

- Revokes the SCIM token immediately
- Stops all automated provisioning
- Leaves existing team members and groups in place
- Does **not** re-enable JIT provisioning automatically (enable it manually if needed)

# Troubleshooting & Reference

> **Enterprise feature**
SSO and SCIM features are available on the **Enterprise** plan.


This page covers diagnostic tools, common issues, emergency recovery, and the technical details of the frugally.app SSO and SCIM implementation.

## Diagnostic logs

The **Diagnostics** tab on the [SSO settings page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/sso) shows the 50 most recent events across both SAML and SCIM. Each entry includes:

- **Timestamp**
- **Protocol** --- SAML or SCIM
- **Event type** --- What happened (authentication attempt, configuration change, provisioning action, etc.)
- **Status** --- Success or failure
- **Error code and message** (if applicable)
- **IP address and user agent**

Diagnostic logs are retained for **26 months**.

## Common SAML issues

### "Invalid signature" or "Signature validation failed"

**Cause:** The SAML response or assertion signature does not match any active certificate in frugally.app.

**Fix:**
1. Check that the certificate on the **Certificates** tab matches what your IdP is using to sign responses
2. If your IdP recently rotated its certificate, upload the new certificate
3. Ensure your IdP is signing both the response **and** the assertion (frugally.app requires both)

### "Invalid audience" or "Audience mismatch"

**Cause:** The Audience Restriction in the SAML assertion does not match the frugally.app SP Entity ID.

**Fix:** In your IdP's SAML settings, set the Audience URI (SP Entity ID) to `https://dashboard.frugally.app/saml`.

### "Invalid timestamp" or "Assertion expired"

**Cause:** The SAML assertion timestamp is outside the allowed window.

**Fix:**
- Ensure your IdP server clock is accurate (NTP synced)
- frugally.app allows a **2-minute** clock skew tolerance
- If the issue persists, check that your IdP is not caching or replaying old assertions

### "Email not found in assertion"

**Cause:** The SAML assertion does not include a recognisable email attribute.

**Fix:** Configure your IdP to release one of the supported email attributes. See the [attribute mappings table](setting-up-saml-sso.md#attribute-mappings) for accepted attribute names.

### "User not found" (JIT disabled)

**Cause:** The user authenticated successfully but does not exist in frugally.app, and JIT provisioning is disabled.

**Fix:** Either enable JIT provisioning, add the user manually, or provision them via [SCIM](scim-provisioning.md).

### "Domain not verified"

**Cause:** The user's email domain has not been verified in frugally.app.

**Fix:** Add and verify the domain on the **Domains** tab. See [Step 5](setting-up-saml-sso.md#step-5--verify-your-email-domain) of the SAML setup guide.

### "Configuration not verified"

**Cause:** You are trying to enable or enforce SSO without a successful test.

**Fix:** Click **Test SSO** and complete a successful authentication. The test must have passed within the last **24 hours** to enable enforcement.

### Certificate expiry warning

frugally.app warns you **30 days** before a certificate expires. If the certificate expires:

- SSO authentication will fail
- You cannot enforce SSO if any certificate expires within **7 days**

**Fix:** Upload your IdP's new certificate on the **Certificates** tab before removing the old one.

## Common SCIM issues

### "Invalid token" or 401 responses

**Cause:** The bearer token sent by your IdP does not match.

**Fix:**
1. Generate a new token in frugally.app and update it in your IdP
2. Check that your IdP is sending the token in the `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header

### "Token expired"

**Cause:** The SCIM token has passed its expiry date (default: 365 days).

**Fix:** Generate a new token in frugally.app and update it in your IdP.

### "Feature disabled"

**Cause:** The SCIM endpoint is being called but the Enterprise plan or SCIM feature is not active.

**Fix:** Contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) to confirm your plan includes SCIM.

### "User already exists"

**Cause:** A user with the same email already exists in the team (possibly added manually or via JIT).

**Note:** This is not necessarily an error. frugally.app handles this gracefully --- the existing user is attached to the team with their provisioning source updated to `scim`.

### User not deprovisioned after removal from IdP

**Cause:** Your IdP may not be pushing a DELETE or deactivation request.

**Fix:**
1. Check that your IdP is configured to push deprovisioning events
2. Verify the SCIM token is still valid
3. Check the Diagnostics tab for recent SCIM events

### SCIM sync shows as stale

**Cause:** No SCIM requests have been received in the last **30 days**.

**Fix:**
1. Verify your IdP is still sending provisioning requests
2. Check that the SCIM token has not expired
3. Test the connection from your IdP's SCIM configuration page

### Group members not syncing

**Cause:** The SCIM group exists but has not been mapped to a frugally.app Group.

**Fix:** On the Provisioning tab, click **Create & Map** next to the SCIM group to link it to a platform Group.

## Break-glass recovery

If your IdP is unavailable or SSO is misconfigured and enforcement is enabled, use the break-glass recovery mechanism:

1. Retrieve your recovery token (stored when SSO was enforced)
2. Visit: `https://dashboard.frugally.app/auth/saml/recovery/{team-slug}?token={recovery-token}`
3. You will have **15 minutes** to log in with email and password
4. The recovery token is **single-use** --- once used, generate a new one from the SSO settings page

> **Caution**
If you have lost your recovery token, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) for assistance. Keep your recovery token in a secure location that does not depend on your IdP.


## Plan downgrade behaviour

If your team downgrades from Enterprise:

- SSO enters a **30-day grace period** where it remains enabled but not enforced
- After the grace period, SSO is fully disabled
- Users can sign in with email and password during and after the grace period
- SCIM tokens are revoked when the plan changes

## SAML attribute reference

frugally.app checks these attribute names in order. The first match is used.

# Members and Invitations

This page covers how to invite new team members, manage pending invitations, and remove users from your frugally.app workspace.

[Manage Team Members](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/team)

---

## Inviting team members

### Single invite

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team** > **Invite Member**
2. Enter the email address
3. Select a [role](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions) (Member is the default)
4. Optionally assign to a [Group](/docs/roles-and-access/groups)
5. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited user receives an email with a link to accept the invitation and create their account.

### Bulk invite via CSV

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team** > **Bulk Invite**
2. Upload a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | Yes | The user's email address |
| `role` | No | `admin`, `member`, or `viewer` (default: `member`) |
| `group` | No | Group name to assign the user to |

3. Review the parsed list
4. Click **Send All Invitations**

### SCIM provisioning (Enterprise)

Enterprise teams using an identity provider can automatically provision users via SCIM. See [SCIM Provisioning](/docs/sso/scim-provisioning) for setup instructions.

---

## Invitation states

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Invitation sent, user has not yet accepted |
| **Accepted** | User accepted the invitation and created their account |
| **Expired** | Invitation was not accepted within 7 days |

### Managing pending invitations

From the Team Members page:

- **Resend** — Send the invitation email again (resets the 7-day expiry)
- **Revoke** — Cancel the invitation before it is accepted

---

## Removing team members

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team**
2. Find the member and click the menu icon
3. Select **Remove from Team**
4. Confirm the removal

When a member is removed:

- Their access is revoked immediately
- Their active sessions are terminated
- Their Schedules and Targets remain (they are team resources, not personal)
- Their Execution history is preserved for audit purposes
- They are removed from all [Groups](/docs/roles-and-access/groups)

> **Caution**
Removing the last Admin leaves only the Owner with administrative access. Ensure at least one Admin remains if the Owner is not actively managing the workspace.


---

## Changing roles

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team**
2. Click the member's current role
3. Select the new role from the dropdown
4. The change takes effect immediately

See [Roles and Permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions) for what each role can do.

---

## Transferring ownership

Only the current Owner can transfer ownership:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team**
2. Find the target user (must be an existing Admin)
3. Click the menu icon > **Transfer Ownership**
4. Confirm with your password

After transfer, the previous Owner is demoted to Admin. There can only be one Owner at a time.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/team-management/security-settings

# Security Settings

Security settings let Admins and Owners configure session management, multi-factor authentication, IP restrictions, and SSO enforcement for the team.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Security**.

---

## Session timeout

Control how long a user's session remains active before requiring re-authentication.

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Session duration** | 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 7 days (default), 30 days |
| **Idle timeout** | 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, disabled (default) |

- **Session duration** — The maximum time a session can last, regardless of activity
- **Idle timeout** — How long a session can remain inactive before expiring

When a session expires, the user is redirected to the sign-in page. Any unsaved work in forms is lost.

> **Tip**
For teams handling sensitive cost data, set session duration to 8 hours and idle timeout to 30 minutes. This ensures sessions expire at the end of the workday and after periods of inactivity.


---

## Enforced MFA

Require all team members to set up multi-factor authentication before they can access frugally.app.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Require MFA** | When enabled, users without MFA are prompted to set it up on their next sign-in |
| **Supported methods** | Authenticator app (TOTP), security key (WebAuthn) |
| **Grace period** | How long users have to set up MFA after the requirement is enabled (default: 7 days) |

After the grace period, users without MFA are blocked from accessing the dashboard until they complete setup.

> **Note**
If SSO is enforced, MFA may be handled by your identity provider instead. Check your IdP's MFA settings to avoid requiring MFA in both places.


---

## IP allowlisting

Restrict access to frugally.app to specific IP addresses or ranges.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allowed IPs** | A list of IP addresses or CIDR ranges (e.g. `203.0.113.0/24`) |
| **Apply to** | All users, or specific roles (e.g. only Members and Viewers) |
| **Bypass for Admins** | Optionally allow Admins and Owners to access from any IP |

When IP allowlisting is enabled, requests from non-allowed IPs receive a "Forbidden" response.

> **Caution**
Before enabling IP allowlisting, ensure your own IP is in the allowed list. If you lock yourself out, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) for assistance.


---

## SSO enforcement

Force all team members to sign in through your SAML SSO identity provider instead of using email/password.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Require SSO** | When enabled, the email/password sign-in option is hidden |
| **Bypass for Owner** | The Owner can always sign in with email/password as a recovery mechanism |

SSO enforcement requires a configured SAML SSO integration. See [Setting Up SAML SSO](/docs/sso/setting-up-saml-sso) for setup instructions.

> **Enterprise feature**
SSO enforcement is available on the Enterprise plan. SSO sign-in (without enforcement) is available on Pro and Enterprise.


---

## Audit log

All security-related events are logged in the audit log at **Settings** > **Audit Log**:

| Event | What is logged |
|-------|---------------|
| **Sign-in** | User, IP address, timestamp, method (password, SSO, MFA) |
| **Sign-out** | User, timestamp |
| **Session expired** | User, reason (timeout, idle, revoked) |
| **MFA enabled/disabled** | User, method |
| **Security setting changed** | Who changed it, what changed, before/after values |
| **IP blocked** | IP address, user (if identified), timestamp |


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/team-management/feature-flags

# Feature Flags

Feature flags let Admins and Owners enable or disable optional features for the team. Use them to control access to beta features, gradually roll out new functionality, or disable features that are not relevant to your workflow.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Feature Flags**.

---

## Available feature flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **AI Intent (Slack)** | Enable natural-language queries via `@frugally` mentions in Slack | Enabled |
| **Slack Reactions** | Allow emoji reactions on Slack messages to trigger actions | Enabled |
| **Drift Detection** | Enable IaC drift detection via the GitHub integration | Enabled |
| **Cost Anomaly Detection** | Enable automated cost anomaly detection and alerts | Enabled |
| **Executive Dashboard Sharing** | Allow generating share links for the Executive Dashboard | Disabled |
| **Resource Locks** | Enable the ability to lock resources from automation | Enabled |
| **Maturity Assessment** | Enable the FinOps Maturity Assessment tool | Enabled |
| **Auto Top-Up** | Enable automatic credit top-up when balance is low | Disabled |

> **Note**
Available flags depend on your plan. Some flags are only visible on Pro or Enterprise plans.


---

## Enabling and disabling flags

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Feature Flags**
2. Toggle the switch next to the flag you want to change
3. The change takes effect immediately for all team members

No restart or sign-out is required. Users currently on a page that uses a disabled feature will see a message indicating the feature is unavailable.

---

## Impact of disabling a flag

| Feature | What happens when disabled |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **AI Intent** | `@frugally` mentions in Slack are ignored |
| **Slack Reactions** | Emoji reactions on frugally.app messages have no effect |
| **Drift Detection** | Drift checks stop running; existing drift alerts remain visible |
| **Cost Anomaly Detection** | Anomaly monitoring pauses; existing anomalies remain visible |
| **Executive Dashboard Sharing** | Share link generation is hidden; existing share links are revoked |
| **Resource Locks** | Lock/unlock actions are hidden; existing locks remain in effect |
| **Maturity Assessment** | Assessment page is hidden; existing results remain visible |
| **Auto Top-Up** | Automatic top-ups stop; existing payment methods remain |

---

## Beta features

Occasionally, frugally.app releases new features behind a beta flag. Beta features:

- Are clearly labelled with a "Beta" badge
- May change behaviour between releases
- Are disabled by default
- Can be enabled by Admins and Owners who want early access

> **Tip**
Enable beta features in a non-production context first to understand their behaviour before enabling them for the whole team.


---

## Feature flags and SCIM

Feature flags are team-level settings and are not affected by SCIM provisioning. SCIM manages users and groups; feature flags are managed separately by Admins and Owners.


---

## Notifications

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/notifications/overview

# Notifications Overview

frugally.app sends notifications to keep your team informed about Executions, Schedules, cost anomalies, Guard events, and access changes. Notifications can be delivered in-app, via Slack, or by email.

---

## Notification channels

| Channel | Description | Configuration |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **In-app** | Notifications appear in the frugally.app dashboard notification centre | Always enabled |
| **Slack** | Messages posted to configured Slack channels | Requires [Slack integration](/docs/getting-started/connecting-slack) |
| **Email** | Emails sent to team members | Enabled per user in notification preferences |

---

## How notifications relate to integrations

Slack is both an **integration** (with slash commands, AI mentions, and the Home Tab) and a **notification channel**. The distinction is:

| Aspect | Integration features | Notification features |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Direction** | User → frugally.app (commands, queries) | frugally.app → user (alerts, results) |
| **Configuration** | Settings > Slack | Settings > Notifications |
| **Content** | Responses to user actions | Automatic alerts and updates |

For Slack integration features (commands, mentions, Home Tab), see [Integrations — Slack](/docs/integrations/slack/overview).

---

## Notification layers

Notifications are configured at two levels:

| Level | Who controls it | What it controls |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **[Team policies](./team-policies.md)** | Admins and Owners | Which notifications are mandatory, where they are routed, and team-wide defaults |
| **[User preferences](./user-preferences.md)** | Individual users | Personal overrides for non-mandatory notifications (mute, channel, digest vs real-time) |

Team policies set the baseline; user preferences customise on top of it.

---

## In this section

- **[Notification Types](./notification-types.md)** — Full catalogue of all notification events
- **[Team Policies](./team-policies.md)** — Admin-managed team-wide notification rules
- **[User Preferences](./user-preferences.md)** — Individual notification customisation


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/notifications/user-preferences

# User Preferences

Individual users can customise their notification settings to control which notifications they receive, how they are delivered, and when they arrive. User preferences override team defaults for non-mandatory notifications.

---

## Accessing notification preferences

Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications** > **My Preferences**, or click the notification bell icon in the dashboard and select **Preferences**.

---

## What you can customise

### Muting notifications

For any notification type that is not [mandatory](./team-policies.md), you can:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Mute** | Stop receiving this notification entirely |
| **Unmute** | Resume receiving this notification |

Muted notifications are still logged in the notification centre — they just do not trigger alerts in Slack, email, or the in-app bell.

> **Note**
Mandatory notifications cannot be muted. They are marked with a lock icon in the preferences panel.


---

### Channel preferences

Choose how each notification type is delivered to you:

| Channel | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **In-app** | Always on (cannot be disabled) |
| **Slack DM** | On or off — receive notifications as personal Slack DMs |
| **Email** | On or off — receive notifications by email |

Channel preferences are per notification type. For example, you can receive Execution results via Slack DM but mute them from email, while receiving budget alerts via both.

> **Tip**
If you find email notifications too noisy, switch to Slack DMs for day-to-day alerts and keep email enabled only for critical events like budget breaches and access changes.


---

### Digest vs real-time

For each channel, choose between:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Real-time** | Notifications are delivered immediately when the event occurs |
| **Hourly digest** | Notifications are batched and delivered once per hour |
| **Daily digest** | Notifications are batched and delivered once per day |

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Digest time** | For daily digests: choose when to receive them (default: 9 AM in your timezone) |
| **Digest day** | For weekly digests (if available): choose which day |

Digest mode is available for Slack DM and email. Channel notifications (posted to team channels) are always real-time.

---

## Notification centre

The in-app notification centre (bell icon in the dashboard header) shows all your notifications:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Unread count** | Badge showing the number of unread notifications |
| **Filter** | Filter by type (Automate, Intelligence, Guard, Team) |
| **Mark as read** | Mark individual or all notifications as read |
| **Click to navigate** | Click a notification to go to the related page (Execution detail, Budget, Project, etc.) |

---

## Managing notification overload

If you are receiving too many notifications:

1. **Mute low-priority types** — Disable notifications you do not need to act on (e.g. "Schedule created", "Scan completed")
2. **Switch to digests** — Batch non-urgent notifications into hourly or daily digests
3. **Use channel preferences** — Disable email for frequent events and rely on Slack DMs instead
4. **Talk to your Admin** — If team policies are too aggressive, ask your Admin to review the [team notification policies](./team-policies.md)

---

## Resetting preferences

Click **Reset to Defaults** at the bottom of the preferences page to revert all settings to the team policy defaults. This does not affect mandatory notifications (they remain enforced regardless).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/notifications/team-policies

# Team Policies

Team notification policies let Admins and Owners set team-wide rules for how notifications are delivered. Policies define which notifications are mandatory, where they are routed, and what the default settings are for all team members.

---

## Configuring team policies

Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Team Policies**.

---

## Mandatory vs optional notifications

Each notification type can be set as:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Mandatory** | All team members receive this notification. Individual users cannot mute it. |
| **Optional (enabled by default)** | Enabled for all users, but individuals can mute it in their [preferences](./user-preferences.md). |
| **Optional (disabled by default)** | Disabled for all users, but individuals can enable it in their preferences. |

### Recommended mandatory notifications

| Notification | Why it should be mandatory |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Execution failed** | Failed Executions may indicate permission or connectivity issues that need immediate attention |
| **Budget breached** | Budget breaches represent overspend that the team should be aware of |
| **Cost anomaly detected** | Anomalies can indicate billing surprises that compound quickly |
| **Project submitted** | Approvers need to be notified to review pending Projects |

---

## Channel routing rules

Route specific notification types to specific Slack channels:

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| **All Guard notifications → #finops-alerts** | Keep governance alerts in a dedicated channel |
| **All Execution results → #cloud-ops** | Keep automation results in the ops channel |
| **Budget breaches → #finance** | Alert finance stakeholders directly |
| **Critical violations → #incidents** | Route critical issues to the incident channel |

### Creating a routing rule

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Team Policies** > **Routing Rules**
2. Click **Add Rule**
3. Select the notification type(s)
4. Select the Slack channel
5. Save

Multiple rules can apply to the same notification type — the notification is sent to all matching channels.

> **Note**
Routing rules apply in addition to the default channel. If a notification's default is Slack and you add a routing rule to a second channel, it is posted to both.


---

## Digest settings

Admins can set team-wide digest preferences:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Digest frequency** | Real-time (default), hourly digest, daily digest |
| **Digest time** | For daily digests: what time to send (default: 9 AM in team timezone) |
| **Digest content** | Summary only, or summary with details |

Digest settings apply to email and Slack DM notifications. Channel notifications are always real-time.

Individual users can override the digest setting in their [preferences](./user-preferences.md) if the notification is not mandatory.

---

## Role-based policies

Policies can be scoped to specific roles:

| Policy | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Admins receive all Guard notifications** | Ensures governance oversight |
| **Viewers receive execution summaries only** | Reduces noise for read-only users |
| **Owner receives all billing notifications** | Keeps the account owner informed |

---

## Policy inheritance

When multiple policies apply, they are merged:

1. **Mandatory** overrides everything — if any policy marks a notification as mandatory, it cannot be muted
2. **Channel routing** is additive — notifications go to all channels specified by all matching policies
3. **Digest settings** use the most frequent option — if one policy says real-time and another says daily, the user gets real-time


---

## Advanced

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions

# IAM Role Permissions

This is the complete reference for every IAM policy frugally.app uses. Each section shows the exact JSON policy statements, what they allow, and when they are needed.

All policies follow the [principle of least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) — frugally.app only requests the permissions it needs for the features you enable.

---

## Trust policy

Every IAM role used by frugally.app requires a **trust policy** that allows frugally.app to assume the role. This is the same for both Organisation and Standalone setups.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::829513654501:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Principal.AWS` | The frugally.app AWS account (`829513654501`). Only this account can assume the role. |
| `sts:ExternalId` | A unique token generated by frugally.app for your Connection. Prevents [confused-deputy attacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html). |

Replace `YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID` with the value shown in the frugally.app connection form or Organisation wizard.

---

## Execution policy

The execution policy grants frugally.app access to discover and manage your resources. This is the core policy needed for scheduling start/stop actions.

### Resource discovery

Required for all Connections. Lets frugally.app scan your account for supported resources.

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyResourceDiscovery",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "tag:GetResources",
    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
    "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
    "ec2:DescribeTags",
    "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
    "rds:ListTagsForResource",
    "lambda:ListFunctions",
    "lambda:GetFunction",
    "lambda:ListTags",
    "ecs:DescribeServices",
    "ecs:ListServices",
    "ecs:ListClusters",
    "ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints",
    "ec2:DescribeNatGateways"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### EC2 actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyEC2Actions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:StartInstances",
    "ec2:StopInstances",
    "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### RDS actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyRDSActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "rds:StartDBInstance",
    "rds:StopDBInstance",
    "rds:ModifyDBInstance"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Lambda actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyLambdaActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "lambda:PutFunctionConcurrency",
    "lambda:DeleteFunctionConcurrency"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

frugally.app manages Lambda functions by setting reserved concurrency to **0** (effectively disabling the function) or removing the concurrency limit (re-enabling it).

### ECS actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyECSActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ecs:UpdateService"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

frugally.app manages ECS services by setting the desired count to **0** (stop) or restoring it to the previous value (start).

### VPC Endpoint actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyVpcEndpointActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:CreateVpcEndpoint",
    "ec2:DeleteVpcEndpoints",
    "ec2:ModifyVpcEndpoint"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### NAT Gateway actions

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyNatGatewayActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:CreateNatGateway",
    "ec2:DeleteNatGateway",
    "ec2:DescribeAddresses"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

`ec2:DescribeAddresses` is needed to read Elastic IP information when recreating NAT Gateways.

---

## Intelligence policy

Required when **Cost Explorer**, **Commitment Utilisation**, or **Anomaly Detection** features are enabled.

### Cost Explorer

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyCostExplorerReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
    "ce:GetCostForecast",
    "ce:GetDimensionValues",
    "ce:GetTags",
    "ce:GetReservationUtilization",
    "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Anomaly Detection

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyAnomalyDetection",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ce:GetAnomalies",
    "ce:GetAnomalyMonitors",
    "ce:GetAnomalySubscriptions"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyCURReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyCURS3ReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::*-cur-*",
    "arn:aws:s3:::*-cur-*/*"
  ]
}
```

The S3 permissions are scoped to buckets matching `*-cur-*`. If your CUR bucket has a different naming convention, replace the resource ARNs with your specific bucket.

---

## CloudTrail policy

Required when the **CloudTrail** feature is enabled (used for resource history tracking).

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyCloudTrailReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
    "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",
    "cloudtrail:LookupEvents",
    "cloudtrail:GetEventSelectors"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## Organisations policy

Required on the **management account** role when using the Organisation setup. This lets frugally.app discover and list member accounts.

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyOrganizationsReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
    "organizations:ListAccounts",
    "organizations:DescribeAccount",
    "organizations:ListTagsForResource"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

> **Note**
The management account policy does **not** include resource execution actions (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.) because scheduling actions are performed via member account roles, not the management account.


---

## Guard policy

Required when **Guard Scans** are enabled. Allows frugally.app to read resource configurations for compliance checking.

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyGuardReadAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
    "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
    "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
    "s3:GetBucketEncryption",
    "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
    "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
    "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
    "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## Tag-based restrictions

For extra security, you can add IAM **conditions** to restrict frugally.app to only manage resources with specific tags. For example, to limit actions to resources tagged `managed-by: frugally`:

```json
{
  "Sid": "FrugallyEC2Actions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:StartInstances",
    "ec2:StopInstances",
    "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute"
  ],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:ResourceTag/managed-by": "frugally"
    }
  }
}
```

Apply the same `Condition` block to any action statement you want to restrict. The tag key and value must exactly match the tags on your AWS resources.

> **Caution**
Tag conditions on `Describe*` and `List*` actions may prevent frugally.app from discovering resources. Only apply tag restrictions to **action** statements (Start, Stop, Modify, etc.), not discovery statements.


For more on tag filtering in frugally.app, see [Resource Tag Filtering](./resource-tag-filtering.md).

## Export formats

The Organisation Setup Wizard can export policies in three formats.

### CloudFormation

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'IAM Role for Frugally cross-account access'

Parameters:
  ExternalId:
    Type: String
    Description: External ID for Frugally cross-account access
    Default: 'YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID'
    NoEcho: true

        Condition = {
          StringEquals = {
            "sts:ExternalId" = var.frugally_external_id
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

# Schedule Format Reference

frugally.app uses standard CRON expressions to define when Schedules run. This page is the complete reference for CRON syntax, operators, and common patterns.

For an introduction to scheduling concepts, see [CRON and Schedule Types](/docs/automate/schedules/cron-and-schedule-types).

---

## CRON syntax

frugally.app uses standard 5-field CRON syntax:

```
┌───────────── minute (0–59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1–31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12 or JAN–DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0–6 or SUN–SAT, where 0 = Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Any valid CRON expression is supported.

---

## Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `*` | Every value | `* * * * *` | Every minute |
| `,` | List of values | `0,30 * * * *` | At minute 0 and 30 |
| `-` | Range of values | `0 9-17 * * *` | Every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM |
| `/` | Step values | `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |

Operators can be combined:

| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0 9-17/2 * * *` | Every 2 hours from 9 AM to 5 PM |
| `0 8,12,18 * * 1-5` | At 8 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM on weekdays |

---

## Common patterns

| Pattern | Expression | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Weekdays at 7 PM | `0 19 * * 1-5` | Monday to Friday at 7:00 PM |
| Weekdays at 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1-5` | Monday to Friday at 8:00 AM |
| Every day at 11 PM | `0 23 * * *` | Every night at 11:00 PM |
| Every Monday at 6 AM | `0 6 * * 1` | Weekly on Monday |
| First of the month at 6 AM | `0 6 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st |
| Every 2 hours on weekdays | `0 */2 * * 1-5` | Monday to Friday, every 2 hours |
| Every 15 minutes | `*/15 * * * *` | Every quarter hour |
| Friday at 6 PM | `0 18 * * 5` | Weekly on Friday evening |
| Monday at 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1` | Weekly on Monday morning |

---

## Day of week reference

| Value | Day |
|-------|-----|
| `0` | Sunday |
| `1` | Monday |
| `2` | Tuesday |
| `3` | Wednesday |
| `4` | Thursday |
| `5` | Friday |
| `6` | Saturday |

You can also use three-letter abbreviations: `SUN`, `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`.

---

## Month reference

| Value | Month |
|-------|-------|
| `1` | January |
| `2` | February |
| `3` | March |
| `4` | April |
| `5` | May |
| `6` | June |
| `7` | July |
| `8` | August |
| `9` | September |
| `10` | October |
| `11` | November |
| `12` | December |

Three-letter abbreviations are also supported: `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, etc.

---

## Timezone handling

All CRON expressions are evaluated in the timezone configured on the Schedule. frugally.app automatically handles Daylight Saving Time transitions:

- **Spring forward:** If the scheduled time falls in the skipped hour, the Execution runs at the next valid minute
- **Fall back:** If the scheduled time falls in the repeated hour, the Execution runs once (first occurrence)

Select UTC if you prefer a fixed offset with no DST adjustments.

---

## Tips

- Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build and validate your expressions
- There is no harm in running an Execution against resources already in the desired state — frugally.app reports them as "already in target state" and takes no action
- A nightly stop schedule is a useful safety net even if resources should already be off — it catches anything left running accidentally

> **Tip**
Set a stop schedule every evening as a safety net. Even if resources are already off, frugally.app skips them without consuming credits. This protects against resources being manually started and forgotten.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/advanced/webhooks

# Webhooks

Webhooks let you receive real-time HTTP notifications from frugally.app when events occur — Executions complete, budgets are breached, anomalies are detected, and more. Use them to integrate frugally.app with your own tools, dashboards, or automation pipelines.

---

## What webhooks are

A webhook is an HTTP POST request sent from frugally.app to a URL you specify whenever a configured event occurs. The request body contains a JSON payload describing the event.

---

## When to use webhooks

| Use case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Custom dashboards** | Send Execution results to a BI tool or internal dashboard |
| **Incident management** | Trigger a PagerDuty or Opsgenie alert on Execution failure |
| **Cost tracking** | Send cost anomaly data to a finance system |
| **Audit logging** | Forward all events to a centralised logging platform |
| **Custom automation** | Trigger a Lambda function or CI/CD pipeline on specific events |

---

## Configuring webhook endpoints

Navigate to **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Create Endpoint**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | The HTTPS endpoint to receive webhook payloads |
| **Events** | Which event types to send (select one or more) |
| **Description** | A label for this endpoint (e.g. "PagerDuty — failures only") |
| **Enabled** | Whether the endpoint is active |

### Supported events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `execution.started` | An Execution has begun |
| `execution.completed` | An Execution completed successfully |
| `execution.failed` | An Execution failed |
| `execution.partially_failed` | An Execution completed with partial failures |
| `schedule.activated` | A Schedule was set to Active |
| `schedule.paused` | A Schedule was set to Inactive |
| `budget.threshold_reached` | A Budget threshold was crossed |
| `budget.breached` | A Budget was exceeded |
| `anomaly.detected` | A cost anomaly was detected |
| `anomaly.resolved` | A cost anomaly resolved |
| `violation.created` | A Guard Violation was created |
| `violation.resolved` | A Guard Violation was resolved |
| `project.submitted` | A Guard Project was submitted for review |
| `project.approved` | A Guard Project was approved |
| `project.rejected` | A Guard Project was rejected |
| `scan.completed` | A Guard Scan completed |

---

## Authentication (HMAC signing)

Every webhook request includes an `X-Frugally-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body. Use this to verify that the request came from frugally.app and was not tampered with.

### Verifying the signature

1. Retrieve your webhook signing secret from **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Signing Secret**
2. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using the signing secret
3. Compare the computed signature with the value in the `X-Frugally-Signature` header

### Example (Node.js)

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(body, signature, secret) {
  const computed = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(computed)
  );
}
```

> **Caution**
Always verify the signature before processing webhook payloads. Unverified webhooks could be spoofed by a third party.


---

## Retry policy

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code or does not respond within 10 seconds, frugally.app retries the delivery:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1st retry | 1 minute |
| 2nd retry | 5 minutes |
| 3rd retry | 30 minutes |
| 4th retry | 2 hours |
| 5th retry | 12 hours |

After 5 failed retries, the delivery is marked as failed. You can view failed deliveries and manually retry them from **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Delivery Log**.

### Automatic disabling

If an endpoint fails to respond to 10 consecutive deliveries, it is automatically disabled. You will receive an email notification. Re-enable it from the Webhooks settings page after fixing the issue.

---

## Payload format

All payloads follow the same envelope structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "execution.completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-17T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique event identifier (use for deduplication) |
| `type` | The event type string |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred |
| `data` | Event-specific payload |

---

## Managing webhooks

From **Settings** > **Webhooks** you can:

- **Edit** — Change the URL, events, or description
- **Disable/Enable** — Toggle without deleting
- **Delete** — Remove the endpoint permanently
- **View delivery log** — See recent deliveries with status, response code, and payload
- **Test** — Send a test payload to verify your endpoint is working

# How do I use Tags to filter the resources?

A Resource in frugally.app represents one or many resources in your AWS Accounts. You can use Tags to tell frugally.app about the Resources in AWS you wish for it to manage.

- Tags are entered in the format `Key:Value`, with each new line representing a new key pair.
- A maximum of 50 tag lines can be specified.
- Tag lines work on an `and` basis. i.e. it will only return resources that have all the matching keys.

```
Environment:develop
Name:user-api
```
*This example will only return EC2 instances tagged with both sets of tags*

You can optionally only specify a tag key. It will match every instance with that key regardless of value.

```
Environment
```
*This example will return EC2 instances that have the Environment tag set with any value.*

You can also specify multiple tag values using a `,` to separate them. Multiple tag values work on an `or` basis, meaning it will match every instance that has at least one of the values.

```
Environment:develop,staging
```
*This example will return EC2 instances that have the Environment tag set with a value of either develop or staging.*

```
Live
Environment:develop,staging
```
*This example will return EC2 instances that have the Live tag set with any value AND the Environment tag set with a value of either develop or staging.*

## API Reference

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/api-reference/overview

# API Reference Overview

frugally.app provides REST APIs for programmatic access to key platform features. Use these APIs to integrate frugally.app into your existing tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and internal dashboards.

---

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.frugally.app/v1
```

---

## Authentication

frugally.app supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Use case | Header |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **API key** | Server-to-server integrations, scripts, CI/CD | `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` |
| **OAuth token** | User-context requests from web applications | `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>` |

### Generating an API key

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/api-keys).
2. Click **Create API Key**.
3. Give the key a descriptive name (e.g. `CI Pipeline — Guard checks`).
4. Select the permission scope — keys can be scoped to specific features (Guard, SCIM, etc.).
5. Copy the key immediately — it is only shown once.

> **Caution**
Treat API keys like passwords. Do not commit them to source control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.


---

## Versioning

The API is versioned via the URL path (`/v1`). When breaking changes are introduced, a new version is published and the previous version remains available for a deprecation period.

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `v1` | **Current** | All endpoints documented here |

---

## Rate limiting

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute (per key) | 120 |
| Burst (concurrent requests) | 10 |

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait.

---

## Common request patterns

### Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results. Use `page` and `per_page` query parameters:

```
GET /v1/guard/projects?page=2&per_page=25
```

| Parameter | Default | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `page` | `1` | — |
| `per_page` | `25` | `100` |

The response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 2,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total_pages": 4,
    "total_count": 87
  }
}
```

### Filtering

Most list endpoints support filtering via query parameters:

```
GET /v1/guard/projects?status=active&connection_id=conn_abc123
```

### Sorting

Use the `sort` parameter with a field name. Prefix with `-` for descending order:

```
GET /v1/guard/violations?sort=-created_at
```

---

## Common response format

### Success responses

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }
}
```

### Error responses

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The connection_id field is required.",
    "details": [
      { "field": "connection_id", "message": "This field is required." }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Error codes

| HTTP status | Code | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|
| `400` | `bad_request` | Malformed request body or parameters |
| `401` | `unauthorized` | Missing or invalid authentication |
| `403` | `forbidden` | Valid authentication but insufficient permissions |
| `404` | `not_found` | Resource does not exist |
| `409` | `conflict` | Resource state conflict (e.g. duplicate name) |
| `422` | `validation_error` | Request body failed validation |
| `429` | `rate_limited` | Too many requests — check `Retry-After` header |
| `500` | `internal_error` | Unexpected server error — contact support |

---

## Available APIs

| API | Description | Documentation |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **Guard API v1** | Manage projects, budgets, violations, and scans | [Guard API →](guard-api-v1.md) |
| **SCIM API** | Provision and deprovision users and groups via SCIM 2.0 | [SCIM API →](scim-api.md) |
| **Webhook payloads** | Event payload schemas delivered to your webhook endpoints | [Webhook payloads →](webhook-payloads.md) |

---

## SDKs and tools

frugally.app does not currently provide official SDKs. The REST API can be called from any HTTP client:

```bash
# Example: List Guard projects
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $FRUGALLY_API_KEY" \
  https://api.frugally.app/v1/guard/projects
```

> **Tip**
Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or [httpie](https://httpie.io) to explore the API interactively during development.


---

If you encounter issues with the API, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) with:

- The full request URL and method
- The response status code and body
- Your API key ID (not the key itself)

# Webhook Payloads

This page documents the payload schemas for each webhook event type. For webhook configuration, HMAC verification, and retry policies, see [Webhooks](/docs/advanced/webhooks).

---

## Common envelope

  "type": "execution.completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-10T19:00:05Z",
  "team_id": "team_xyz",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique event ID — use for deduplication |
| `type` | `string` | Event type (see table below) |
| `timestamp` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred |
| `team_id` | `string` | The team that owns the resource |
| `data` | `object` | Event-specific payload (documented per event below) |

---

## Event types

## Verifying webhook signatures

Each webhook delivery includes an `X-Frugally-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. Verify it against the raw request body using your webhook signing secret:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(payload_body, signature_header, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload_body,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(f"sha256={expected}", signature_header)
```

For full details, see [Webhooks — HMAC signing](/docs/advanced/webhooks).

# SCIM API

frugally.app supports the [SCIM 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644) standard for automated user and group provisioning. Use SCIM to keep your frugally.app team membership in sync with your identity provider (IdP) — such as Okta, Azure AD, or OneLogin.

For general API conventions, see the [API Reference Overview](overview.md). For SCIM setup instructions, see [SCIM Provisioning](/docs/sso/scim-provisioning).

> **Enterprise feature**
SCIM provisioning is available on the Enterprise plan only.


---

## Base URL

```
https://api.frugally.app/scim/v2
```

---

## Authentication

SCIM requests use a Bearer token generated in the frugally.app dashboard:

```
Authorization: Bearer <scim-token>
```

Generate a SCIM token at **Settings** > **SSO & Provisioning** > **SCIM Token**.

---

## Supported resources

| Resource | Endpoint | Operations |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Users | `/scim/v2/Users` | Create, Read, Update, Deactivate, List |
| Groups | `/scim/v2/Groups` | Create, Read, Update, Delete, List |

---

## Users

### List users

```
GET /scim/v2/Users
```

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `filter` | `string` | SCIM filter expression (e.g. `userName eq "alice@example.com"`) |
| `startIndex` | `integer` | 1-based pagination start (default: 1) |
| `count` | `integer` | Results per page (default: 25, max: 100) |

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
  "totalResults": 42,
  "startIndex": 1,
  "itemsPerPage": 25,
  "Resources": [
    {
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
      "id": "user_abc123",
      "userName": "alice@example.com",
      "name": {
        "givenName": "Alice",
        "familyName": "Smith"
      },
      "emails": [
        { "value": "alice@example.com", "primary": true }
      ],
      "active": true,
      "groups": [
        { "value": "group_xyz", "display": "Engineering" }
      ],
      "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User",
        "created": "2025-01-10T09:00:00Z",
        "lastModified": "2025-02-15T14:30:00Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get a user

```
GET /scim/v2/Users/:id
```

### Create a user

```
POST /scim/v2/Users
```

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
  "userName": "bob@example.com",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "Bob",
    "familyName": "Jones"
  },
  "emails": [
    { "value": "bob@example.com", "primary": true }
  ],
  "active": true
}
```

When a user is created via SCIM, frugally.app sends a welcome email and assigns the default role configured in team settings.

### Update a user

```
PUT /scim/v2/Users/:id
```

Full replacement of the user resource. Include all fields — omitted fields are reset to defaults.

### Patch a user

```
PATCH /scim/v2/Users/:id
```

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
  "Operations": [
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "path": "name.givenName",
      "value": "Robert"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deactivate a user

To deactivate (soft-delete) a user, set `active` to `false`:

```
PATCH /scim/v2/Users/:id
```

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
  "Operations": [
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "path": "active",
      "value": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Deactivated users lose access to the dashboard and API but their data is retained.

---

## Groups

### List groups

```
GET /scim/v2/Groups
```

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|

| `startIndex` | `integer` | 1-based pagination start |
| `count` | `integer` | Results per page |

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
  "totalResults": 5,
  "startIndex": 1,
  "itemsPerPage": 25,
  "Resources": [
    {
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"],
      "id": "group_xyz",
      "displayName": "Engineering",
      "members": [
        { "value": "user_abc123", "display": "alice@example.com" },

  "displayName": "Platform Team",
  "members": [
    { "value": "user_abc123" }
  ]
}
```

Groups created via SCIM are mapped to frugally.app [Groups](/docs/roles-and-access/groups), inheriting the same scope and notification policies.

### Update a group

```
PUT /scim/v2/Groups/:id
```

### Patch a group (add/remove members)

```
PATCH /scim/v2/Groups/:id
```

  "Operations": [
    {
      "op": "add",
      "path": "members",
      "value": [{ "value": "user_ghi789" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Remove members:**

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
  "Operations": [
    {
      "op": "remove",
      "path": "members[value eq \"user_ghi789\"]"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Delete a group

```
DELETE /scim/v2/Groups/:id
```

---

## Supported SCIM filters

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `eq` (equals) | `userName eq "alice@example.com"` |
| `co` (contains) | `userName co "example.com"` |
| `sw` (starts with) | `name.familyName sw "Sm"` |

Multiple filters can be combined with `and`:

```
filter=userName co "example.com" and active eq true
```

---

## Error responses

SCIM errors follow the SCIM 2.0 error schema:

```json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error"],
  "status": "409",

## FAQs

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/faqs/credits-and-billing

# Credits and Billing

Common questions about frugally.app's credit-based billing model, plans, and payments.

---

## How does billing work?

frugally.app uses a credit-based model. You purchase credits and they are consumed as you use the platform. There is no standing monthly charge — you only pay for what you use.

See [Billing Overview](/docs/billing/overview) for a full introduction.

---

## What are credits?

Credits are the billing unit for frugally.app. Different actions consume different amounts of credits:

| Action | Credit cost |
|--------|------------|
| Execution (per resource actioned) | Varies by service |
| Guard scan | Varies by project size |
| API call | Varies by endpoint |

For the full breakdown, see [Credit Usage and Enforcement](/docs/billing/credit-usage-and-enforcement).

---

## What plans are available?

| | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|-|------|-----|------------|
| **Credits** | Limited monthly allowance | Pay-as-you-go | Custom volume pricing |
| **Connections** | Up to 2 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Schedules** | Up to 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Guard projects** | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **SSO / SCIM** | — | — | Included |
| **Support** | Community | Standard | Priority |

See [Plans and Credits](/docs/billing/plans-and-credits) for the full comparison.

---

## How do I add credits?

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing** in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/billing).
2. Click **Top Up Credits**.
3. Choose an amount and complete the payment.

You can also enable [Auto Top-Up](/docs/billing/auto-top-up) to automatically purchase credits when your balance drops below a threshold.

---

## What happens when I run out of credits?

When your credit balance reaches zero:

- Active Schedules are paused
- Guard scans are suspended
- Dashboard access and historical data remain available
- A notification is sent to all team admins

Top up your balance to resume. See [Credit Usage and Enforcement](/docs/billing/credit-usage-and-enforcement#what-happens-when-credits-run-out) for details.

---

## Do credits expire?

No. Credits do not expire while your account is active.

---

## Can I get a refund?

Unused credits are non-refundable. If you believe you were charged in error, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) within 30 days.

---

## How do I get an invoice?

Invoices are generated monthly and available at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Invoices**. They are also emailed to the billing contact on file. See [Payment Methods and Invoices](/docs/billing/payment-methods-and-invoices).

---

## Troubleshooting

For billing issues, see [Billing and Credits Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/billing-and-credits).


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/faqs/how-to-cancel-remove-frugally-app

# How do I cancel or remove frugally.app?

frugally.app uses a credit-based billing model with no standing charge. You only pay for what you use. If you want to stop using frugally.app, there are several options depending on how completely you want to disconnect.

---

## Option 1: Pause usage (keep your account)

If you want to stop incurring costs but keep your account and configuration:

1. **Disable all Schedules** — Go to [Schedules](https://dashboard.frugally.app/schedules) and set each Schedule to **Inactive**. This stops all automated Executions.
2. **Disable Auto Top-Up** — Go to **Settings** > **Billing** > **Auto Top-Up** and toggle it off.

With no active Schedules and no auto top-up, you will not be charged. Your Connections, Targets, and configuration remain in place if you decide to resume later.

---

## Option 2: Uninstall the Slack app

If you want to remove frugally.app from your Slack workspace:

1. Go to **Slack Admin** > **Manage Apps** > **frugally.app** > **Remove App**.
2. This disconnects Slack commands, notifications, and the Home Tab.
3. Your frugally.app account and dashboard access remain active — you can still use the dashboard directly.

---

## Option 3: Delete your account permanently

If you want to permanently delete your account and all associated data:

1. Contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) and request account deletion.
2. The support team will confirm the deletion scope with you.
3. Once confirmed, all data is permanently deleted within 30 days.

---

## Data retention after cancellation

| Data type | Retention |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Execution history** | Deleted with account |
| **Cost data** | Deleted with account (this data comes from your AWS account and remains available there) |
| **Team and user data** | Deleted with account |
| **Invoices** | Retained for 7 years for legal and tax compliance |

---

## Credit refund policy

- **Unused credits** are non-refundable. Credits do not expire while your account is active.
- If you believe you were charged in error, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) within 30 days.

---

## Removing IAM roles from AWS

After cancelling, you may want to clean up the IAM roles created for frugally.app:

1. Delete the `FrugallyAccessRole` (or `FrugallyOrganizationRole`) from each AWS account.
2. If you used CloudFormation, delete the CloudFormation stack to remove all associated resources.

Leaving the IAM roles in place has no security impact — they can only be assumed by frugally.app's trusted account, and with no active Connections, they are never used.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/faqs/data-and-security

# Data and Security

Common questions about how frugally.app handles your data, security practices, and compliance.

---

## What data does frugally.app access?

frugally.app accesses your AWS account via an IAM role that you create and control. The data accessed depends on which features you enable:

| Feature | Data accessed |
|---------|--------------|
| **Automate (stop/start)** | EC2, RDS, ECS, and other supported resource metadata (instance IDs, states, tags) |
| **Cost Explorer** | Aggregated cost and usage data from the AWS Cost Explorer API |
| **CloudTrail** | Trail configuration metadata (not log contents) |
| **CUR** | Cost and Usage Report definitions and data |

frugally.app does **not** access:

- Application data stored on your instances
- S3 object contents (beyond CUR report data)
- Secrets, credentials, or environment variables
- Network traffic or logs

---

## What permissions does frugally.app need?

frugally.app follows the principle of least privilege. The IAM role permissions are scoped to the specific actions needed for each feature. See [IAM Policy Reference](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions) for the full policy with per-service breakdowns.

You control the permissions — you can remove any permission you don't want to grant, though this may affect the features that depend on it.

---

## Where is my data stored?

| Data type | Storage location |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Team, user, and configuration data | AWS infrastructure in the EU (London region) |
| Cost and usage data | AWS infrastructure in the EU (London region) |
| Execution logs | AWS infrastructure in the EU (London region) |
| Payment information | Processed by Stripe — frugally.app does not store card details |

---

## Is my data encrypted?

| State | Encryption |
|-------|-----------|
| **In transit** | TLS 1.2+ for all API and web traffic |
| **At rest** | AES-256 encryption for all stored data |
| **IAM credentials** | Temporary credentials only — frugally.app uses `sts:AssumeRole` and never stores long-term AWS credentials |

---

## Can frugally.app modify my AWS resources?

Only if you explicitly grant permission. frugally.app can stop, start, or scale resources **only** for the services included in the IAM policy you attach to the role. You can remove any action permission to prevent modifications.

frugally.app never creates or deletes AWS resources (other than stopping/starting existing ones).

---

## Who can access my data in frugally.app?

Access is controlled by your team's role and scope configuration:

- **Roles** determine what actions a user can perform. See [Roles and Permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions).
- **Scopes** limit which Connections and resources a user can see. See [Scopes](/docs/roles-and-access/scopes).
- **SSO enforcement** ensures only users authenticated via your identity provider can access the team. See [Security Settings](/docs/team-management/security-settings).

---

## Does frugally.app share my data with third parties?

No. frugally.app does not sell, share, or provide your data to third parties. Data is only used to deliver the frugally.app service.

For full details, see the [Privacy Policy](https://frugally.app/privacy).

---

## What happens to my data if I cancel?

- All data is permanently deleted within 30 days of account deletion.
- Invoices are retained for 7 years for legal and tax compliance.
- See [How do I cancel or remove frugally.app?](how-to-cancel-remove-frugally-app.md) for the full cancellation process.

---

## Compliance and certifications

For questions about specific compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.), contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app).

---

## Responsible disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to [security@frugally.app](mailto:security@frugally.app). We take security reports seriously and will respond promptly.


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/faqs/what-aws-resources-do-you-support

# What AWS resources do you support?

frugally.app supports a wide range of AWS services for stop/start scheduling, scaling, and cost analysis.

---

## Supported services summary

| Service | Actions | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **EC2** | Stop, Start, Terminate | All instance types including Linux, Windows, shared tenancy, dedicated tenancy |
| **RDS** | Stop, Start | Single-AZ and Multi-AZ instances, Aurora clusters |
| **ECS** | Scale down, Scale up | Fargate and EC2 launch types — adjusts desired task count |
| **Auto Scaling Groups** | Scale down, Scale up | Adjusts min/max/desired capacity |
| **EKS** | Scale node groups | Adjusts managed node group sizes |
| **Redshift** | Pause, Resume | Serverless and provisioned clusters |
| **SageMaker** | Stop, Start | Notebook instances and endpoints |
| **DocumentDB** | Stop, Start | Cluster-level stop/start |
| **Neptune** | Stop, Start | Cluster-level stop/start |

For the full list with per-service details, required IAM permissions, and limitations, see [Supported Services](/docs/automate/targets/supported-services).

---

## Cost analysis coverage

Beyond stop/start scheduling, frugally.app analyses costs across **all AWS services** via Cost Explorer and CUR integration. This means you can track and budget for services like S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB even if they are not supported for stop/start actions.

See [Cost Explorer](/docs/intelligence/cost-explorer) and [Commitment Utilisation](/docs/intelligence/commitment-utilisation) for more on cost analysis.

---

## Requesting new services

If you need support for an AWS service not listed above, contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app). New service support is prioritised based on customer demand.

# Roles and Access

Common questions about roles, permissions, groups, scopes, and access requests in frugally.app.

---

## What roles are available?

frugally.app has four built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards, cost data, and execution history |
| **Contributor** | Everything in Viewer, plus create and manage Targets, Schedules, and Guard projects |
| **Admin** | Everything in Contributor, plus manage team settings, billing, integrations, and user roles |
| **Owner** | Full access including account deletion. Assigned to the user who created the team |

For the full permissions matrix, see [Roles and Permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions).

---

## How do I change a user's role?

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team** in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/team).
2. Find the user and click **Edit**.
3. Select the new role and save.

Only **Admin** and **Owner** roles can change other users' roles.

---

## What are groups?

Groups are collections of users that share access policies and notification preferences. For example, you might create an "Engineering" group with access to development Connections and a "Finance" group with access to cost data only.

See [Groups](/docs/roles-and-access/groups) for details.

---

## What are scopes?

Scopes are permission boundaries that limit what a user or group can see and act on. A scope can restrict visibility to specific Connections, accounts, or resource tags.

See [Scopes](/docs/roles-and-access/scopes) for details.

---

## How do access requests work?

If a user needs access to a resource or project outside their current scope, they can submit an access request:

1. The user clicks **Request Access** on the restricted resource.
2. An admin or designated approver receives a notification.
3. The approver approves or denies the request with an optional note.
4. The user is notified of the decision.

See [Access Requests](/docs/roles-and-access/access-requests) for details.

---

## Can I use SSO to manage access?

Yes. On the Enterprise plan, you can configure SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning to manage users and groups from your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc.).

- [Setting Up SAML SSO](/docs/sso/setting-up-saml-sso)
- [SCIM Provisioning](/docs/sso/scim-provisioning)

---

## What plan do I need for advanced access controls?

| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| Basic roles (Viewer, Contributor, Admin) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Groups | — | Yes | Yes |
| Scopes | — | Yes | Yes |
| Access requests | — | Yes | Yes |
| SSO (SAML) | — | — | Yes |
| SCIM provisioning | — | — | Yes |

See [Plans and Credits](/docs/billing/plans-and-credits) for the full plan comparison.

# GitHub Integration

Common questions about the frugally.app GitHub integration — installation, IaC scanning, drift detection, and PR reviews.

---

## What does the GitHub integration do?

The GitHub integration connects frugally.app to your GitHub repositories to provide:

- **IaC scanning** — Analyse Terraform, CloudFormation, and Pulumi files in pull requests for cost and compliance issues
- **Drift detection** — Compare your IaC-defined state against live AWS resources to identify manual changes
- **PR review and authorship** — Track who changed what infrastructure and surface cost impact in PR comments

See [GitHub Integration Overview](/docs/integrations/github/overview) for a full introduction.

---

## How do I install the GitHub App?

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub** in the [frugally.app dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/integrations).
2. Click **Connect GitHub** and follow the authorisation flow.
3. Select which repositories the app should have access to.

You need **Owner** or **Admin** permissions in your GitHub organisation to install apps. For the full walkthrough, see [GitHub Installation](/docs/integrations/github/installation).

---

## Which IaC tools are supported?

| Tool | File types | Supported |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Terraform** | `.tf`, `.tfvars` | Yes |
| **CloudFormation** | `.yaml`, `.json` (with CloudFormation template markers) | Yes |
| **Pulumi** | Language-specific files with Pulumi configuration | Yes |
| **CDK** | Synthesised CloudFormation output | Yes (via CloudFormation scanning) |

---

## Is the GitHub integration required?

No. The GitHub integration is entirely optional. frugally.app's core features (Automate, Intelligence, Guard) work without it. The integration adds shift-left capabilities for teams that manage infrastructure as code.

---

## Does IaC scanning slow down my PRs?

IaC scans typically complete within 30–60 seconds. The scan runs as a GitHub check and does not block merging unless you configure branch protection rules to require it.

---

## Does drift detection modify my AWS resources?

No. Drift detection is read-only. It compares the desired state (from IaC) against the live state (from AWS) and reports differences. It never makes changes to your AWS resources.

---

## Troubleshooting

For common issues with the GitHub integration, see [GitHub Integration Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/github-integration).

# Guard and Budgets

Common questions about Guard projects, budgets, scans, and cost governance.

---

## What is Guard?

Guard is frugally.app's cost governance engine. It helps you set budgets, track compliance, detect policy violations, and enforce approval workflows before infrastructure changes happen. See [Guard Overview](/docs/guard/overview) for a full introduction.

---

## How do budgets work?

A budget sets a spending limit for a specific scope — such as a project, service, account, or tag group. frugally.app tracks actual AWS spend against the budget and alerts you when thresholds are breached.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where does cost data come from?** | AWS Cost Explorer. Your Connection must have Cost Explorer enabled and verified |
| **How often is spend updated?** | Cost data refreshes periodically — typically within 24 hours of the spend occurring in AWS |
| **Can I set multiple thresholds?** | Yes — e.g. alert at 80% and again at 100% |
| **What happens when a budget is exceeded?** | A [violation](/docs/guard/violations-and-remediation) is created and notifications are sent to the configured channels |

For details, see [Budgets](/docs/guard/budgets).

---

## What are Guard scans?

Guard scans evaluate your cloud resources against compliance and cost-optimisation rules. Scans produce findings — specific issues with recommendations for remediation.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **How often do scans run?** | Configurable per project — daily, weekly, or on-demand |
| **Do scans consume credits?** | Yes. See [Credit Usage and Enforcement](/docs/billing/credit-usage-and-enforcement) |
| **Can I suppress false positives?** | Yes — individual findings can be suppressed with a reason |

For details, see [Scans and Findings](/docs/guard/scans-and-findings).

---

## What is a Guard project?

A project is a governance container that groups Connections, budgets, approval rules, and scan configurations together. Projects let you apply different governance policies to different parts of your infrastructure.

For details, see [Projects](/docs/guard/projects/overview).

---

## Do I need approval rules?

Approval rules are optional. They add an approval workflow for infrastructure changes — useful for production environments or changes above a certain cost threshold. You can configure approval rules per project.

For details, see [Approval Rules](/docs/guard/projects/approval-rules).

---

## What plan do I need for Guard?

| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| Budgets | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Guard projects | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Scans | Manual only | Scheduled + manual | Scheduled + manual |
| Approval workflows | — | Basic | Advanced (multi-level) |

See [Plans and Credits](/docs/billing/plans-and-credits) for the full plan comparison.

# General Troubleshooting

This page covers the general approach to troubleshooting issues in frugally.app, how to check platform status, and how to contact support.

---

## Troubleshooting methodology

When something isn't working as expected, follow these steps:

1. **Check the status page** — Confirm there are no ongoing platform incidents.
2. **Review recent changes** — Did you recently update IAM policies, change a Schedule, or modify team settings?
3. **Check the Executions page** — Look for error messages on recent Executions at [dashboard.frugally.app/executions](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions).
4. **Review Connection health** — Verify your Connections are in a **Connected** state at [dashboard.frugally.app/connections](https://dashboard.frugally.app/connections).
5. **Consult the relevant troubleshooting guide** — Use the topic-specific pages below.
6. **Contact support** if the issue persists.

---

## Platform status

Check the frugally.app status page for real-time information about platform availability and ongoing incidents:

[status.frugally.app](https://status.frugally.app)

You can subscribe to status updates via email or RSS to be notified of incidents automatically.

Source: https://frugally.app/docs/troubleshooting/aws-connections

# AWS Connections

This page covers troubleshooting for AWS Connection issues — health statuses, IAM permission errors, and feature verification failures.

---

## Connection health statuses

Every Connection in frugally.app has a health status that reflects whether the IAM role is working and enabled features are accessible.

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Connected** | Green | IAM role works and all enabled features are verified |
| **Degraded** | Yellow | IAM role works, but one or more features could not be verified. Core scheduling still functions |
| **Missing Permissions** | Red | frugally.app cannot assume the IAM role. No operations can run |
| **Disabled** | Grey | Connection deactivated — manually or due to plan limits |
| **Unknown** | Grey | Connection not yet verified (initial state after creation) |

---

## Missing Permissions

**Symptom:** Connection shows **Missing Permissions** (red badge).

**Cause:** frugally.app cannot call `sts:AssumeRole` to assume your IAM role.

**Checklist:**

1. **Role name mismatch** — The role name in frugally.app must exactly match the IAM role name in AWS (case-sensitive). Default names:
   - Standalone: `FrugallyAccessRole`
   - Organisation management account: `FrugallyOrganizationRole`

2. **External ID mismatch** — The External ID in your frugally.app Connection must match the `sts:ExternalId` condition in the IAM trust policy. Copy it again from the Connection form if unsure.

3. **Trust policy principal** — The IAM trust policy must allow `arn:aws:iam::829513654501:root` to assume the role.

4. **Role does not exist** — Verify the role exists in the correct AWS account. You may have created it in the wrong account.

5. **AWS account ID** — Double-check the 12-digit account ID in frugally.app matches the account where the role exists.

**To fix:** Correct the role name, External ID, or trust policy in AWS, then click **Verify** on the Connections page.

> **Tip**
The most common cause is a copy-paste error in the External ID. Open the Connection edit page in frugally.app and copy the External ID again.


---

## Degraded

**Symptom:** Connection shows **Degraded** (yellow badge).

**Cause:** The IAM role works, but one or more enabled features failed verification.

### Cost Explorer not detected

- Ensure the `ce:Get*` permissions are included in the execution policy.
- Ensure Cost Explorer is [activated in the AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home#/cost-explorer). Cost Explorer must be explicitly enabled before it can be queried.
- For Organisation setups, Cost Explorer must be activated in the **management account**.

### CloudTrail not detected

- Ensure `cloudtrail:` permissions are in the policy.
- Ensure at least one trail is configured in the account, or an organisation-wide trail exists.
- Check the [CloudTrail console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home) to verify trails exist.

### CUR not detected

- Ensure `cur:DescribeReportDefinitions` is in the policy.
- Ensure a Cost and Usage Report is configured in the [Billing console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/reports).
- Ensure the S3 bucket permissions (`s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket`) match the bucket where CUR is delivered. The default policy scopes to `*-cur-*` bucket names.

### Organisation not detected as management account

- The account ID provided may not be the management account. Run `aws organizations describe-organization` in the CLI to check.

**To fix:** Update the IAM policy or AWS configuration as needed, then click **Verify** in frugally.app.

---

## Disabled

**Symptom:** Connection shows **Disabled** (grey badge).

**Cause:** The Connection is inactive. Two possible scenarios:

1. **Manually deactivated** — Someone toggled the Connection to inactive. Re-activate it from the Connection edit page.
2. **Plan limit reached** — Your plan has a maximum number of active Connections. Excess Connections are automatically disabled. Upgrade your plan or remove unused Connections to re-enable.

---

## Unknown

**Symptom:** Connection shows **Unknown** (grey badge).

**Cause:** The Connection was just created and has not been verified yet. Click **Verify** to run the first check. Verification usually runs automatically within a few seconds of creation.

---

## How verification works

When frugally.app verifies a Connection, it performs these checks in order:

### 1. Assume the IAM role

frugally.app calls `sts:AssumeRole` with the configured role name and External ID.

- **Fails** → status is set to **Missing Permissions**. No further checks run.
- **Succeeds** → temporary credentials are obtained and feature checks proceed.

### 2. Detect organisation membership

For Connections with scope **Member**, frugally.app calls `organizations:DescribeOrganization` to check if the account belongs to an AWS Organisation.

- If the account is **not** in an organisation, the scope is automatically changed to **Standalone**.
- If the check fails due to permissions, the result is recorded but does not block the Connection.

### 3. Check enabled features

For each enabled feature, frugally.app makes a test API call:

| Feature | Test call | Success | Failure |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Cost Explorer** | `ce:GetCostAndUsage` | CE API is accessible | Missing `ce:` permissions or CE not activated |
| **CloudTrail** | `cloudtrail:DescribeTrails` | At least one trail exists | Missing `cloudtrail:` permissions or no trails |
| **CUR** | `cur:DescribeReportDefinitions` | At least one report exists | Missing `cur:` permissions or no CUR configured |

### 4. Determine final status

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Role assumption failed | **Missing Permissions** |
| Role works, all features verified | **Connected** |
| Role works, one or more features failed | **Degraded** |
| Connection is inactive or disabled by plan | **Disabled** |

---

## Organisation verification

Organisation verification follows the same pattern with additional checks:

- **Management account detection** — frugally.app calls `organizations:DescribeOrganization` and compares the returned management account ID with your account ID. A mismatch results in a **Degraded** status.
- **Organisation-level features** — Cost Explorer, CloudTrail (organisation-wide trails), and CUR are checked via the management account credentials.

---

## Re-verification

You can manually re-verify any Connection at any time by clicking **Verify** on the Connections page. This is useful after:

- Updating IAM permissions
- Enabling or disabling features
- Fixing a trust policy issue
- Changing the role name or External ID

---

## CloudFormation stack issues

If you deployed the IAM role using the CloudFormation template:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Stack creation failed | Check the **Events** tab in CloudFormation for the specific error. Common causes: insufficient permissions to create IAM roles, or a role with the same name already exists |
| Stack rolled back | The template may reference resources that don't exist in your account. Review the template parameters |
| Stack update failed | If updating an existing stack, ensure you are not removing permissions that frugally.app currently depends on |

---

## Still stuck?

If none of the above resolves your issue:

1. Collect the Connection ID, AWS account ID, and any error messages.
2. Contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app).

# Executions and Schedules

This page covers troubleshooting for Execution failures and Schedules not triggering as expected.

---

## Execution failures

### Common failure causes

| Cause | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **IAM permission denied** | Error message references `AccessDenied` or `UnauthorizedAccess` | Update the IAM policy to include the required permissions. See [IAM Policy Reference](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions) |
| **Resource not found** | Error references a specific resource ID that no longer exists | The resource may have been terminated outside of frugally.app. Remove it from the Target or re-scan |
| **Connection unhealthy** | Execution fails immediately with a connection error | Check the Connection health on the [Connections page](https://dashboard.frugally.app/connections). See [AWS Connections](aws-connections.md) |
| **Rate limiting** | AWS API throttling errors | frugally.app automatically retries throttled requests. If it persists, reduce the number of resources in the Target or stagger Schedules |
| **Resource in transitional state** | Resource is in a `pending`, `stopping`, or `shutting-down` state | Wait for the resource to reach a stable state and retry. frugally.app skips resources in transitional states |

### Partial failures

An Execution can partially succeed — some resources are actioned while others fail. Check the Execution detail page for per-resource results:

- **Actioned** — The resource was successfully stopped/started/scaled
- **Already in state** — The resource was already in the desired state (no action needed)
- **Failed** — The action failed for this specific resource (hover for the error message)
- **Skipped** — The resource was skipped (e.g. due to a lock or transitional state)

> **Tip**
Partial failures are common when IAM permissions are correct for some resource types but missing for others. Check which resources failed and ensure the IAM policy covers those specific services.


### Execution stuck in "Running"

If an Execution appears stuck in the **Running** state:

1. **Wait** — Large Targets with many resources can take several minutes. frugally.app processes resources in batches.
2. **Check AWS** — Verify the resources in AWS to see if they have actually changed state.
3. **Timeout** — Executions have a maximum runtime. If exceeded, the Execution is marked as **Failed** with a timeout error.

---

## Schedule not triggering

### The Schedule is paused

**Symptom:** The Schedule exists but no Executions are created at the expected time.

**Check:** Open the Schedule and verify the **Status** is **Active** (not Inactive). Paused Schedules do not trigger Executions.

### Timezone mismatch

**Symptom:** The Execution runs at the wrong time.

**Cause:** The Schedule's timezone does not match your expectation.

**Check:** Open the Schedule and confirm the timezone is correct. All times are interpreted in the configured timezone.

> **Tip**
If your team spans multiple timezones, consider creating separate Schedules per region. See [CRON and Schedule Types](/docs/automate/schedules/cron-and-schedule-types#timezone-handling) for DST behaviour.


### No Targets assigned

**Symptom:** The Schedule triggers but the Execution has zero resources.

**Check:** Ensure the Schedule has at least one Target assigned. Open the Schedule and verify the **Targets** field is not empty.

### Target has no resources

**Symptom:** The Execution completes with "0 resources found".

**Cause:** The Target's tag filters or Connection scope do not match any resources.

**Check:**
1. Open the Target and review the tag filters.
2. Run a [dry run](/docs/automate/targets/dry-runs) to see which resources the Target currently matches.
3. Verify the Connection is healthy.

### Day-of-week configuration

**Symptom:** The Schedule does not trigger on certain days.

**Check:** For Weekly schedules, verify the correct days are selected. For CRON expressions, check the day-of-week field (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.). See [Schedule Format Reference](/docs/advanced/schedule-format#day-of-week-reference).

### One-time schedule already ran

**Symptom:** A one-time Schedule does not run again.

**Cause:** One-time Schedules trigger once at the configured date and time, then become inactive. They do not repeat.

---

## DST transitions

frugally.app handles Daylight Saving Time automatically:

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| **Spring forward** (clocks skip ahead) | If the scheduled time falls in the skipped hour, the Execution runs at the next valid minute |
| **Fall back** (clocks repeat an hour) | The Execution runs once on the first occurrence of the repeated hour |

If you need schedules that are unaffected by DST, set the timezone to **UTC**.

---

## Debugging steps

1. **Check Execution history** — Go to [Executions](https://dashboard.frugally.app/executions) and look for the expected Execution. If it exists, click it to view details and per-resource results.
2. **Check Schedule next run** — Open the Schedule and look at the **Next run** field. If it shows a future time, the Schedule is configured correctly and will trigger at that time.
3. **Check Connection health** — A failed Connection blocks all Executions for that Connection.
4. **Run a manual Execution** — Trigger the Target manually to test whether the issue is with the Schedule timing or the Execution itself. See [Manual Executions](/docs/automate/executions/manual-executions).

---

## Still stuck?

Collect the following and contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app):

- Schedule ID and configuration
- Execution ID (if one was created)
- Expected vs actual trigger time
- Any error messages shown


Source: https://frugally.app/docs/troubleshooting/guard

# Guard

This page covers troubleshooting for Guard features — scans, budgets, cost attribution, and project workflows.

---

## Scan failures

### Scan stuck in "Running"

**Symptom:** A Guard scan stays in the **Running** state for an extended period.

**Possible causes:**
- The scan covers a large number of resources across many Connections. Large scans can take several minutes.
- A Connection used by the project has become unhealthy.

**Steps:**
1. Wait a few minutes — large scans take longer.
2. Check Connection health for all Connections associated with the project.
3. If the scan remains stuck after 15 minutes, contact support.

### Scan completed with errors

**Symptom:** The scan completes but reports errors alongside findings.

**Cause:** Some resources could not be evaluated, typically due to IAM permission gaps for specific services.

**Steps:**
1. Review the scan results for error details — the error message indicates which service or resource type failed.
2. Update the IAM policy to include the missing permissions. See [IAM Policy Reference](/docs/advanced/iam-role-permissions).
3. Re-run the scan.

### No findings generated

**Symptom:** The scan completes successfully but produces zero findings.

**Possible causes:**
- All resources are compliant — this is the expected result when everything is in order.
- The project's Connection scope is too narrow — it may not include the accounts where issues exist.
- Tag filters on the project are excluding resources.

---

## Budget issues

### Budget not tracking spend

**Symptom:** A budget shows $0 spend despite active resources.

**Possible causes:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Cost Explorer not enabled** | Budgets rely on Cost Explorer data. Ensure the Connection has Cost Explorer enabled and the feature is verified (green status) |
| **Budget just created** | Cost data is refreshed periodically. New budgets may take up to 24 hours to show spend |
| **Tag filters too restrictive** | If the budget uses tag-based filtering, verify the tags match actual resources in AWS |
| **Wrong account** | Confirm the project's Connections include the account where the spend occurs |

### Budget threshold notification not received

**Symptom:** Spend crossed a threshold but no notification was sent.

**Check:**
1. Verify the threshold is configured on the budget (e.g. 80%, 100%).
2. Check the notification channel — is a Slack channel assigned? Is email enabled?
3. Review the budget's notification history to see if the notification was sent but not delivered.

### Spend amount doesn't match AWS

**Symptom:** The budget spend in frugally.app differs from the AWS Cost Explorer.

**Possible causes:**
- **Timing difference** — frugally.app refreshes cost data periodically. There may be a lag of up to 24 hours.
- **Scope difference** — The budget may be scoped to specific tags or services that don't match your AWS Cost Explorer filters.
- **Blended vs unblended costs** — Ensure you are comparing the same cost type in both systems.

---

## Cost attribution issues

### Resources not attributed to a project

**Symptom:** Some resources appear in AWS but are not attributed to any Guard project.

**Cause:** Resources must match the project's Connection and tag filters to be attributed. Resources outside the project's scope are not included.

**Steps:**
1. Check the project's Connections — does it include the account where the resource lives?
2. Check the project's tag filters — does the resource have the required tags?
3. Run a scan to refresh attribution.

---

## Project workflow issues

### Workflow stuck in a state

**Symptom:** A project approval request is stuck in **Pending** and cannot proceed.

**Possible causes:**
- **Approver unavailable** — The designated approver has not responded. Check who the approvers are and contact them directly.
- **Approval rule conflict** — Multiple approval rules may apply, requiring approvals from different people.

**Steps:**
1. Open the project and review the pending request.
2. Check the approval rules to understand who needs to approve.
3. If an approver is unavailable, an admin can override the approval from the project settings.

### Cannot create a project

**Symptom:** The "Create Project" button is disabled or returns an error.

**Possible causes:**
- **Insufficient permissions** — You need at least the **Contributor** role to create projects. See [Roles and Permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions).
- **Plan limit** — Your plan may have a maximum number of Guard projects. Check your plan limits at **Settings** > **Billing**.
- **No Connections** — At least one healthy Connection is required to create a project.

---

## Still stuck?

Collect the following and contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app):

- Project ID
- Scan ID (if applicable)
- Budget ID (if applicable)

# Billing and Credits

This page covers troubleshooting for billing, credits, invoices, and plan-related issues.

---

## Credit balance issues

### Credit balance showing incorrectly

**Symptom:** Your credit balance does not reflect recent purchases or usage.

**Possible causes:**

| Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| **Recent top-up not processed** | Credit top-ups via card are usually instant. Bank transfers may take 1–3 business days. Check your payment method for confirmation |
| **Pending Executions** | Credits are deducted when Executions complete. If Executions are still running, the balance may not have updated yet |
| **Browser cache** | Hard-refresh the billing page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to see the latest balance |

### Credits running out faster than expected

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing** > **Usage** to view a breakdown of credit consumption.
2. Check which actions are consuming the most credits — Executions, scans, and API calls each have different credit costs.
3. Review your Schedules — a high-frequency Schedule (e.g. hourly) on a large Target consumes more credits than a daily Schedule.
4. See [Credit Usage and Enforcement](/docs/billing/credit-usage-and-enforcement) for the full credit consumption table.

### What happens when credits run out?

When your credit balance reaches zero:

1. Active Schedules are **paused** — no new Executions are triggered.
2. Guard scans are **suspended**.
3. Dashboard access and historical data remain available.
4. A notification is sent to all team admins.

To resume, top up your credit balance or enable [Auto Top-Up](/docs/billing/auto-top-up).

---

## Invoice issues

### Invoice not received

**Checklist:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Email address** | Verify the billing email at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Billing Contact** |
| **Spam folder** | Check spam/junk for emails from `billing@frugally.app` |
| **Invoice frequency** | Invoices are generated monthly. Check the invoice date matches your expectations |
| **Download from dashboard** | All invoices are available at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Invoices** regardless of email delivery |

### Invoice amount seems incorrect

**Steps:**
1. Open the invoice and review the line items.
2. Compare against your credit usage in **Settings** > **Billing** > **Usage**.
3. Check if the invoice includes credits from auto top-up or a plan change.
4. Contact [support@frugally.app](mailto:support@frugally.app) with the invoice number if the discrepancy cannot be explained.

---

## Payment method issues

### Card payment declined

**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient funds
- Card expired — update the card at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Payment Method**
- Your bank blocked the transaction — contact your bank to authorise payments to "Frugally, Inc."
- 3D Secure required — your bank may require additional authentication. Try the payment again and complete the 3DS challenge

### Cannot update payment method

**Steps:**
1. Ensure you have the **Admin** role — only admins can update billing settings.
2. Try a different browser or clear cookies — payment forms use a secure third-party iframe that may be blocked by browser extensions.
3. Disable ad-blockers temporarily — they can interfere with the payment form.

---

## Plan change issues

### Plan change not reflected

**Symptom:** You upgraded or downgraded your plan but the dashboard still shows the old plan.

**Steps:**
1. **Hard-refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R).
2. Check **Settings** > **Billing** > **Plan** for the current plan status.
3. Plan upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period.

### Cannot downgrade plan

**Possible causes:**
- **Active Connections exceed the lower plan limit** — Disable or remove Connections until you are within the target plan's limit.
- **Active Guard projects exceed the lower plan limit** — Archive projects until you are within the limit.
- **Enterprise features in use** — If you use features exclusive to your current plan (e.g. SCIM, SSO), you must disable them before downgrading.

## Auto top-up issues

### Auto top-up not triggering

**Checklist:**
1. Verify auto top-up is **enabled** at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Auto Top-Up**.
2. Check the threshold — auto top-up triggers when your balance drops below the configured threshold.
3. Verify the payment method is valid and not expired.
4. Check if the last auto top-up attempt failed — a failed attempt is logged in the billing history.

### Unexpected auto top-up charge

**Cause:** Your credit balance dropped below the configured threshold, triggering a top-up.

**Steps:**
1. Review credit usage at **Settings** > **Billing** > **Usage** to understand what consumed credits.
2. Adjust the auto top-up threshold or amount if the current settings don't match your usage patterns.
3. See [Auto Top-Up](/docs/billing/auto-top-up) for configuration details.

# Slack Integration

This page covers troubleshooting for the Slack integration — slash commands, AI intent, Home Tab, and reinstallation.

---

## Slash commands not responding

### `/frugally` returns no response

**Checklist:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **App installed** | Verify frugally.app is installed in your Slack workspace. Check **Apps** in the Slack sidebar |
| **App not disabled** | Workspace admins can disable apps. Check **Slack Admin** > **Manage Apps** |
| **Channel permissions** | Some workspaces restrict apps to specific channels. Try the command in a different channel |
| **Integration connected** | In the frugally.app dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack** and verify the status is **Connected** |

### `/frugally` returns "Something went wrong"

**Cause:** The command reached frugally.app but encountered an error.

**Steps:**
1. Try the command again — it may have been a transient error.
2. Check the [status page](https://status.frugally.app) for ongoing incidents.
3. If the error persists, try a simpler command (e.g. `/frugally help`) to verify basic connectivity.

### Slash command response is slow

**Cause:** Slack has a 3-second timeout for initial responses. If frugally.app needs to query AWS, it sends an initial acknowledgement and follows up with the full response.

If the follow-up response never arrives:
1. Check Connection health — the AWS query may have failed.
2. Verify the bot has permission to post in the channel (it needs to be a member or the channel must allow app posts).

---

## AI intent issues

### AI intent not understanding queries

**Symptom:** Using `@frugally` mentions or natural language queries returns incorrect or "I don't understand" responses.

**Tips for better results:**
- Be specific: "What's my EC2 spend this month?" works better than "How much am I spending?"
- Include the resource type or service name when asking about costs.
- Use simple, direct questions rather than compound queries.

### AI intent not responding to @mentions

**Checklist:**
1. Ensure you are using `@frugally` (not `/frugally`) to trigger AI intent.
2. The bot must be a member of the channel. Invite it with `/invite @frugally`.
3. Check that AI intent is enabled in **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack**.

---

## Home Tab issues

### Home Tab not loading

**Symptom:** Clicking the frugally.app Home Tab in Slack shows a blank page or loading spinner.

**Steps:**
1. **Close and reopen** the Home Tab — click away and click back.
2. **Update Slack** — Ensure you are running the latest version of the Slack desktop or mobile app.
3. **Check permissions** — The Home Tab requires the `app_home` scope. If the app was installed before this feature was added, you may need to re-authorise. See [Reinstalling the Slack App](#reinstalling-the-slack-app) below.

### Home Tab showing stale data

**Cause:** The Home Tab refreshes when you navigate to it, but data may be cached briefly.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate away from the Home Tab and back to force a refresh.
2. If data remains stale, check the relevant dashboard page to confirm the current state.

---

## Notification delivery issues

### Execution results not posting to Slack

**Checklist:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Slack channel configured** | Open the Schedule and verify a Slack channel is selected |
| **Bot is in the channel** | The frugally.app bot must be a member of the channel. Invite it with `/invite @frugally` |
| **Channel not archived** | Archived channels cannot receive messages. Unarchive or select a different channel |
| **Integration connected** | Check **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack** for connection status |

### Messages posting to the wrong channel

**Cause:** Each Schedule has its own Slack channel setting. Check the Schedule configuration to verify the correct channel is selected.

---

## Reinstalling the Slack App

If the Slack integration is in a broken state, reinstalling can resolve most issues:

1. **Remove the app** from your Slack workspace:
   - Go to **Slack Admin** > **Manage Apps** > **frugally.app** > **Remove App**.
2. **Disconnect in frugally.app**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack** > **Disconnect**.
3. **Reinstall**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack** > **Connect to Slack**.
   - Authorise the app in your workspace.
   - Re-select Slack channels on your Schedules (these are cleared on disconnect).

> **Caution**
Reinstalling the Slack App clears all channel assignments on Schedules. You will need to reconfigure which Schedules post to which channels.

# GitHub Integration

This page covers troubleshooting for the GitHub integration — app installation, IaC scanning, drift detection, and permission issues.

---

## Installation issues

### GitHub App not appearing in the organisation

**Symptom:** After clicking "Install", the frugally.app GitHub App does not appear in your organisation's installed apps.

**Steps:**
1. Verify you have **Owner** or **Admin** permissions in the GitHub organisation. Only organisation administrators can install GitHub Apps.
2. Check if your organisation requires [admin approval for third-party apps](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/managing-requests-for-personal-access-tokens-in-your-organization). If so, the installation may be pending approval.
3. Try installing again from **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub** in the [frugally.app dashboard](https://dashboard.frugally.app/settings/integrations).

### "Repository access" not showing expected repos

**Symptom:** After installing the GitHub App, some repositories are missing from the selection list.

**Cause:** The GitHub App may be configured with limited repository access.

**Steps:**
1. Go to your GitHub organisation's **Settings** > **GitHub Apps** > **frugally.app** > **Configure**.
2. Under **Repository access**, select either "All repositories" or add the missing repositories to the list.

---

## IaC scanning issues

### Scan not triggering on pull requests

**Symptom:** Opening or updating a pull request does not trigger an IaC scan.

**Checklist:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **GitHub App installed** | Verify the app is installed and has access to the repository |
| **IaC scanning enabled** | Check **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub** — ensure IaC scanning is toggled on |
| **Supported file types** | Scans trigger for Terraform (`.tf`), CloudFormation (`.yaml`, `.json`), and Pulumi files. If the PR only modifies other files, no scan runs |
| **Branch targeting** | Verify the PR targets a branch that frugally.app is configured to monitor (typically `main` or `master`) |
| **Repository access** | Ensure the GitHub App has access to the specific repository (see installation issues above) |

### Scan runs but finds no issues

**Possible causes:**
- The IaC changes are compliant with all configured rules — no action needed.
- The scan rules may not cover the resource types in the PR. Review the scan rule configuration in Guard.

### Scan reports incorrect results

**Steps:**
1. Check the PR comment left by frugally.app for the scan details.
2. Click through to the scan in the dashboard for the full findings list.
3. If a finding seems incorrect, use the **Suppress** action to dismiss it and report a false positive to support.

---

## Drift detection issues

### Drift not being reported

**Symptom:** Resources have been modified in AWS but drift detection does not flag them.

**Checklist:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Drift detection enabled** | Verify drift detection is toggled on in **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub** |
| **Connection healthy** | Drift detection requires healthy Connections to read current resource state |
| **Repository mapping** | Ensure the repository containing your IaC is linked to the correct Connection(s) |
| **Scan schedule** | Drift detection runs on a schedule (not real-time). Check when the last drift scan ran |

### Drift reported for resources you didn't change

**Cause:** Drift detection compares the IaC-defined state against the live AWS state. Changes made outside of IaC (manual console changes, other tools) are flagged as drift.

**Resolution:** Either update your IaC to match the live state, or revert the live resource to match IaC.

---

## Permission and access issues

### "Insufficient permissions" error on GitHub integration page

**Cause:** Your frugally.app role does not have permission to manage integrations.

**Solution:** Ask a team admin to configure the GitHub integration, or request a role upgrade. See [Roles and Permissions](/docs/roles-and-access/roles-and-permissions).

### GitHub webhook delivery failures

**Symptom:** GitHub shows failed webhook deliveries in the App settings.

**Steps:**
1. Go to your GitHub organisation's **Settings** > **GitHub Apps** > **frugally.app** > **Advanced** > **Recent Deliveries**.
2. Check the response code. Common issues:
   - `401` — The integration token may have expired. Re-authenticate in the frugally.app dashboard.
   - `500` — A server-side issue. Check the [status page](https://status.frugally.app) and contact support if it persists.
