# Frugally

> Frugally is a shift-left FinOps platform for AWS. It helps teams automate cloud cost savings by scheduling start, stop, and scale actions on AWS resources; gain intelligence into AWS spending with cost analysis and anomaly detection; and govern infrastructure changes through approval workflows, budgets, and compliance scans. It integrates natively with Slack and GitHub.
